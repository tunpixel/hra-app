 * @ngdoc module
 * @name ngAnimate
 * @description
 *
 * The `ngAnimate` module provides support for JavaScript, CSS3 transition and CSS3 keyframe animation hooks within existing core and custom directives.
 *
 * <div doc-module-components="ngAnimate"></div>
 *
 * # Usage
 *
 * To see animations in action, all that is required is to define the appropriate CSS classes
 * or to register a JavaScript animation via the `myModule.animation()` function. The directives that support animation automatically are:
 * `ngRepeat`, `ngInclude`, `ngIf`, `ngSwitch`, `ngShow`, `ngHide`, `ngView` and `ngClass`. Custom directives can take advantage of animation
 * by using the `$animate` service.
 *
 * Below is a more detailed breakdown of the supported animation events provided by pre-existing ng directives:
 *
 * | Directive                                                                                                | Supported Animations                                                     |
 * |----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 * | {@link ng.directive:ngRepeat#animations ngRepeat}                                                        | enter, leave and move                                                    |
 * | {@link ngRoute.directive:ngView#animations ngView}                                                       | enter and leave                                                          |
 * | {@link ng.directive:ngInclude#animations ngInclude}                                                      | enter and leave                                                          |
 * | {@link ng.directive:ngSwitch#animations ngSwitch}                                                        | enter and leave                                                          |
 * | {@link ng.directive:ngIf#animations ngIf}                                                                | enter and leave                                                          |
 * | {@link ng.directive:ngClass#animations ngClass}                                                          | add and remove (the CSS class(es) present)                               |
 * | {@link ng.directive:ngShow#animations ngShow} & {@link ng.directive:ngHide#animations ngHide}            | add and remove (the ng-hide class value)                                 |
 * | {@link ng.directive:form#animation-hooks form} & {@link ng.directive:ngModel#animation-hooks ngModel}    | add and remove (dirty, pristine, valid, invalid & all other validations) |
 * | {@link module:ngMessages#animations ngMessages}                                                          | add and remove (ng-active & ng-inactive)                                 |
 * | {@link module:ngMessages#animations ngMessage}                                                           | enter and leave                                                          |
 *
 * You can find out more information about animations upon visiting each directive page.
 *
 * Below is an example of how to apply animations to a directive that supports animation hooks:
 *
 * ```html
 * <style type="text/css">
 * .slide.ng-enter, .slide.ng-leave {
 *   -webkit-transition:0.5s linear all;
 *   transition:0.5s linear all;
 * }
 *
 * .slide.ng-enter { }        /&#42; starting animations for enter &#42;/
 * .slide.ng-enter.ng-enter-active { } /&#42; terminal animations for enter &#42;/
 * .slide.ng-leave { }        /&#42; starting animations for leave &#42;/
 * .slide.ng-leave.ng-leave-active { } /&#42; terminal animations for leave &#42;/
 * </style>
 *
 * <!--
 * the animate service will automatically add .ng-enter and .ng-leave to the element
 * to trigger the CSS transition/animations
 * -->
 * <ANY class="slide" ng-include="..."></ANY>
 * ```
 *
 * Keep in mind that, by default, if an animation is running, any child elements cannot be animated
 * until the parent element's animation has completed. This blocking feature can be overridden by
 * placing the `ng-animate-children` attribute on a parent container tag.
 *
 * ```html
 * <div class="slide-animation" ng-if="on" ng-animate-children>
 *   <div class="fade-animation" ng-if="on">
 *     <div class="explode-animation" ng-if="on">
 *        ...
 *     </div>
 *   </div>
 * </div>
 * ```
 *
 * When the `on` expression value changes and an animation is triggered then each of the elements within
 * will all animate without the block being applied to child elements.
 *
 * ## Are animations run when the application starts?
 * No they are not. When an application is bootstrapped Angular will disable animations from running to avoid
 * a frenzy of animations from being triggered as soon as the browser has rendered the screen. For this to work,
 * Angular will wait for two digest cycles until enabling animations. From there on, any animation-triggering
 * layout changes in the application will trigger animations as normal.
 *
 * In addition, upon bootstrap, if the routing system or any directives or load remote data (via $http) then Angular
 * will automatically extend the wait time to enable animations once **all** of the outbound HTTP requests
 * are complete.
 *
 * ## CSS-defined Animations
 * The animate service will automatically apply two CSS classes to the animated element and these two CSS classes
 * are designed to contain the start and end CSS styling. Both CSS transitions and keyframe animations are supported
 * and can be used to play along with this naming structure.
 *
 * The following code below demonstrates how to perform animations using **CSS transitions** with Angular:
 *
 * ```html
 * <style type="text/css">
 * /&#42;
 *  The animate class is apart of the element and the ng-enter class
 *  is attached to the element once the enter animation event is triggered
 * &#42;/
 * .reveal-animation.ng-enter {
 *  -webkit-transition: 1s linear all; /&#42; Safari/Chrome &#42;/
 *  transition: 1s linear all; /&#42; All other modern browsers and IE10+ &#42;/
 *
 *  /&#42; The animation preparation code &#42;/
 *  opacity: 0;
 * }
 *
 * /&#42;
 *  Keep in mind that you want to combine both CSS
 *  classes together to avoid any CSS-specificity
 *  conflicts
 * &#42;/
 * .reveal-animation.ng-enter.ng-enter-active {
 *  /&#42; The animation code itself &#42;/
 *  opacity: 1;
 * }
 * </style>
 *
 * <div class="view-container">
 *   <div ng-view class="reveal-animation"></div>
 * </div>
 * ```
 *
 * The following code below demonstrates how to perform animations using **CSS animations** with Angular:
 *
 * ```html
 * <style type="text/css">
 * .reveal-animation.ng-enter {
 *   -webkit-animation: enter_sequence 1s linear; /&#42; Safari/Chrome &#42;/
 *   animation: enter_sequence 1s linear; /&#42; IE10+ and Future Browsers &#42;/
 * }
 * @-webkit-keyframes enter_sequence {
 *   from { opacity:0; }
 *   to { opacity:1; }
 * }
 * @keyframes enter_sequence {
 *   from { opacity:0; }
 *   to { opacity:1; }
 * }
 * </style>
 *
 * <div class="view-container">
 *   <div ng-view class="reveal-animation"></div>
 * </div>
 * ```
 *
 * Both CSS3 animations and transitions can be used together and the animate service will figure out the correct duration and delay timing.
 *
 * Upon DOM mutation, the event class is added first (something like `ng-enter`), then the browser prepares itself to add
 * the active class (in this case `ng-enter-active`) which then triggers the animation. The animation module will automatically
 * detect the CSS code to determine when the animation ends. Once the animation is over then both CSS classes will be
 * removed from the DOM. If a browser does not support CSS transitions or CSS animations then the animation will start and end
 * immediately resulting in a DOM element that is at its final state. This final state is when the DOM element
 * has no CSS transition/animation classes applied to it.
 *
 * ### Structural transition animations
 *
 * Structural transitions (such as enter, leave and move) will always apply a `0s none` transition
 * value to force the browser into rendering the styles defined in the setup (`.ng-enter`, `.ng-leave`
 * or `.ng-move`) class. This means that any active transition animations operating on the element
 * will be cut off to make way for the enter, leave or move animation.
 *
 * ### Class-based transition animations
 *
 * Class-based transitions refer to transition animations that are triggered when a CSS class is
 * added to or removed from the element (via `$animate.addClass`, `$animate.removeClass`,
 * `$animate.setClass`, or by directives such as `ngClass`, `ngModel` and `form`).
 * They are different when compared to structural animations since they **do not cancel existing
 * animations** nor do they **block successive transitions** from rendering on the same element.
 * This distinction allows for **multiple class-based transitions** to be performed on the same element.
 *
 * In addition to ngAnimate supporting the default (natural) functionality of class-based transition
 * animations, ngAnimate also decorates the element with starting and ending CSS classes to aid the
 * developer in further styling the element throughout the transition animation. Earlier versions
 * of ngAnimate may have caused natural CSS transitions to break and not render properly due to
 * $animate temporarily blocking transitions using `0s none` in order to allow the setup CSS class
 * (the `-add` or `-remove` class) to be applied without triggering an animation. However, as of
 * **version 1.3**, this workaround has been removed with ngAnimate and all non-ngAnimate CSS
 * class transitions are compatible with ngAnimate.
 *
 * There is, however, one special case when dealing with class-based transitions in ngAnimate.
 * When rendering class-based transitions that make use of the setup and active CSS classes
 * (e.g. `.fade-add` and `.fade-add-active` for when `.fade` is added) be sure to define
 * the transition value **on the active CSS class** and not the setup class.
 *
 * ```css
 * .fade-add {
 *   /&#42; remember to place a 0s transition here
 *      to ensure that the styles are applied instantly
 *      even if the element already has a transition style &#42;/
 *   transition:0s linear all;
 *
 *   /&#42; starting CSS styles &#42;/
 *   opacity:1;
 * }
 * .fade-add.fade-add-active {
 *   /&#42; this will be the length of the animation &#42;/
 *   transition:1s linear all;
 *   opacity:0;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * The setup CSS class (in this case `.fade-add`) also has a transition style property, however, it
 * has a duration of zero. This may not be required, however, incase the browser is unable to render
 * the styling present in this CSS class instantly then it could be that the browser is attempting
 * to perform an unnecessary transition.
 *
 * This workaround, however, does not apply to  standard class-based transitions that are rendered
 * when a CSS class containing a transition is applied to an element:
 *
 * ```css
 * /&#42; this works as expected &#42;/
 * .fade {
 *   transition:1s linear all;
 *   opacity:0;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Please keep this in mind when coding the CSS markup that will be used within class-based transitions.
 * Also, try not to mix the two class-based animation flavors together since the CSS code may become
 * overly complex.
 *
 *
 * ### Preventing Collisions With Third Party Libraries
 *
 * Some third-party frameworks place animation duration defaults across many element or className
 * selectors in order to make their code small and reuseable. This can lead to issues with ngAnimate, which
 * is expecting actual animations on these elements and has to wait for their completion.
 *
 * You can prevent this unwanted behavior by using a prefix on all your animation classes:
 *
 * ```css
 * /&#42; prefixed with animate- &#42;/
 * .animate-fade-add.animate-fade-add-active {
 *   transition:1s linear all;
 *   opacity:0;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * You then configure `$animate` to enforce this prefix:
 *
 * ```js
 * $animateProvider.classNameFilter(/animate-/);
 * ```
 * </div>
 *
 * ### CSS Staggering Animations
 * A Staggering animation is a collection of animations that are issued with a slight delay in between each successive operation resulting in a
 * curtain-like effect. The ngAnimate module (versions >=1.2) supports staggering animations and the stagger effect can be
 * performed by creating a **ng-EVENT-stagger** CSS class and attaching that class to the base CSS class used for
 * the animation. The style property expected within the stagger class can either be a **transition-delay** or an
 * **animation-delay** property (or both if your animation contains both transitions and keyframe animations).
 *
 * ```css
 * .my-animation.ng-enter {
 *   /&#42; standard transition code &#42;/
 *   -webkit-transition: 1s linear all;
 *   transition: 1s linear all;
 *   opacity:0;
 * }
 * .my-animation.ng-enter-stagger {
 *   /&#42; this will have a 100ms delay between each successive leave animation &#42;/
 *   -webkit-transition-delay: 0.1s;
 *   transition-delay: 0.1s;
 *
 *   /&#42; in case the stagger doesn't work then these two values
 *    must be set to 0 to avoid an accidental CSS inheritance &#42;/
 *   -webkit-transition-duration: 0s;
 *   transition-duration: 0s;
 * }
 * .my-animation.ng-enter.ng-enter-active {
 *   /&#42; standard transition styles &#42;/
 *   opacity:1;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Staggering animations work by default in ngRepeat (so long as the CSS class is defined). Outside of ngRepeat, to use staggering animations
 * on your own, they can be triggered by firing multiple calls to the same event on $animate. However, the restrictions surrounding this
 * are that each of the elements must have the same CSS className value as well as the same parent element. A stagger operation
 * will also be reset if more than 10ms has passed after the last animation has been fired.
 *
 * The following code will issue the **ng-leave-stagger** event on the element provided:
 *
 * ```js
 * var kids = parent.children();
 *
 * $animate.leave(kids[0]); //stagger index=0
 * $animate.leave(kids[1]); //stagger index=1
 * $animate.leave(kids[2]); //stagger index=2
 * $animate.leave(kids[3]); //stagger index=3
 * $animate.leave(kids[4]); //stagger index=4
 *
 * $timeout(function() {
 *   //stagger has reset itself
 *   $animate.leave(kids[5]); //stagger index=0
 *   $animate.leave(kids[6]); //stagger index=1
 * }, 100, false);
 * ```
 *
 * Stagger animations are currently only supported within CSS-defined animations.
 *
 * ## JavaScript-defined Animations
 * In the event that you do not want to use CSS3 transitions or CSS3 animations or if you wish to offer animations on browsers that do not
 * yet support CSS transitions/animations, then you can make use of JavaScript animations defined inside of your AngularJS module.
 *
 * ```js
 * //!annotate="YourApp" Your AngularJS Module|Replace this or ngModule with the module that you used to define your application.
 * var ngModule = angular.module('YourApp', ['ngAnimate']);
 * ngModule.animation('.my-crazy-animation', function() {
 *   return {
 *     enter: function(element, done) {
 *       //run the animation here and call done when the animation is complete
 *       return function(cancelled) {
 *         //this (optional) function will be called when the animation
 *         //completes or when the animation is cancelled (the cancelled
 *         //flag will be set to true if cancelled).
 *       };
 *     },
 *     leave: function(element, done) { },
 *     move: function(element, done) { },
 *
 *     //animation that can be triggered before the class is added
 *     beforeAddClass: function(element, className, done) { },
 *
 *     //animation that can be triggered after the class is added
 *     addClass: function(element, className, done) { },
 *
 *     //animation that can be triggered before the class is removed
 *     beforeRemoveClass: function(element, className, done) { },
 *
 *     //animation that can be triggered after the class is removed
 *     removeClass: function(element, className, done) { }
 *   };
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * JavaScript-defined animations are created with a CSS-like class selector and a collection of events which are set to run
 * a javascript callback function. When an animation is triggered, $animate will look for a matching animation which fits
 * the element's CSS class attribute value and then run the matching animation event function (if found).
 * In other words, if the CSS classes present on the animated element match any of the JavaScript animations then the callback function will
 * be executed. It should be also noted that only simple, single class selectors are allowed (compound class selectors are not supported).
 *
 * Within a JavaScript animation, an object containing various event callback animation functions is expected to be returned.
 * As explained above, these callbacks are triggered based on the animation event. Therefore if an enter animation is run,
 * and the JavaScript animation is found, then the enter callback will handle that animation (in addition to the CSS keyframe animation
 * or transition code that is defined via a stylesheet).
 *
 *
 * ### Applying Directive-specific Styles to an Animation
 * In some cases a directive or service may want to provide `$animate` with extra details that the animation will
 * include into its animation. Let's say for example we wanted to render an animation that animates an element
 * towards the mouse coordinates as to where the user clicked last. By collecting the X/Y coordinates of the click
 * (via the event parameter) we can set the `top` and `left` styles into an object and pass that into our function
 * call to `$animate.addClass`.
 *
 * ```js
 * canvas.on('click', function(e) {
 *   $animate.addClass(element, 'on', {
 *     to: {
 *       left : e.client.x + 'px',
 *       top : e.client.y + 'px'
 *     }
 *   }):
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * Now when the animation runs, and a transition or keyframe animation is picked up, then the animation itself will
 * also include and transition the styling of the `left` and `top` properties into its running animation. If we want
 * to provide some starting animation values then we can do so by placing the starting animations styles into an object
 * called `from` in the same object as the `to` animations.
 *
 * ```js
 * canvas.on('click', function(e) {
 *   $animate.addClass(element, 'on', {
 *     from: {
 *        position: 'absolute',
 *        left: '0px',
 *        top: '0px'
 *     },
 *     to: {
 *       left : e.client.x + 'px',
 *       top : e.client.y + 'px'
 *     }
 *   }):
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * Once the animation is complete or cancelled then the union of both the before and after styles are applied to the
 * element. If `ngAnimate` is not present then the styles will be applied immediately.

      /**
       * @ngdoc service
       * @name $animate
       * @kind object
       *
       * @description
       * The `$animate` service provides animation detection support while performing DOM operations (enter, leave and move) as well as during addClass and removeClass operations.
       * When any of these operations are run, the $animate service
       * will examine any JavaScript-defined animations (which are defined by using the $animateProvider provider object)
       * as well as any CSS-defined animations against the CSS classes present on the element once the DOM operation is run.
       *
       * The `$animate` service is used behind the scenes with pre-existing directives and animation with these directives
       * will work out of the box without any extra configuration.
       *
       * Requires the {@link ngAnimate `ngAnimate`} module to be installed.
       *
       * Please visit the {@link ngAnimate `ngAnimate`} module overview page learn more about how to use animations in your application.
       * ## Callback Promises
       * With AngularJS 1.3, each of the animation methods, on the `$animate` service, return a promise when called. The
       * promise itself is then resolved once the animation has completed itself, has been cancelled or has been
       * skipped due to animations being disabled. (Note that even if the animation is cancelled it will still
       * call the resolve function of the animation.)
       *
       * ```js
       * $animate.enter(element, container).then(function() {
       *   //...this is called once the animation is complete...
       * });
       * ```
       *
       * Also note that, due to the nature of the callback promise, if any Angular-specific code (like changing the scope,
       * location of the page, etc...) is executed within the callback promise then be sure to wrap the code using
       * `$scope.$apply(...)`;
       *
       * ```js
       * $animate.leave(element).then(function() {
       *   $scope.$apply(function() {
       *     $location.path('/new-page');
       *   });
       * });
       * ```
       *
       * An animation can also be cancelled by calling the `$animate.cancel(promise)` method with the provided
       * promise that was returned when the animation was started.
       *
       * ```js
       * var promise = $animate.addClass(element, 'super-long-animation').then(function() {
       *   //this will still be called even if cancelled
       * });
       *
       * element.on('click', function() {
       *   //tooo lazy to wait for the animation to end
       *   $animate.cancel(promise);
       * });
       * ```
       *
       * (Keep in mind that the promise cancellation is unique to `$animate` since promises in
       * general cannot be cancelled.)
       *

         * |-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
         * | 1. `$animate.animate(...)` is called                                                                                  | `class="my-animation"`                                       |
         * | 2. `$animate` waits for the next digest to start the animation                                                        | `class="my-animation ng-animate"`                            |
         * | 3. `$animate` runs the JavaScript-defined animations detected on the element                                          | `class="my-animation ng-animate"`                            |
         * | 4. the `className` class value is added to the element                                                                | `class="my-animation ng-animate className"`                  |
         * | 5. `$animate` scans the element styles to get the CSS transition/animation duration and delay                         | `class="my-animation ng-animate className"`                  |
         * | 6. `$animate` blocks all CSS transitions on the element to ensure the `.className` class styling is applied right away| `class="my-animation ng-animate className"`                  |
         * | 7. `$animate` applies the provided collection of `from` CSS styles to the element                                     | `class="my-animation ng-animate className"`                  |
         * | 8. `$animate` waits for a single animation frame (this performs a reflow)                                             | `class="my-animation ng-animate className"`                  |
         * | 9. `$animate` removes the CSS transition block placed on the element                                                  | `class="my-animation ng-animate className"`                  |
         * | 10. the `className-active` class is added (this triggers the CSS transition/animation)                                | `class="my-animation ng-animate className className-active"` |
         * | 11. `$animate` applies the collection of `to` CSS styles to the element which are then handled by the transition      | `class="my-animation ng-animate className className-active"` |

 * @name ngAria
 * @description
 *
 * The `ngAria` module provides support for common
 * [<abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">ARIA</abbr>](http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/)
 * attributes that convey state or semantic information about the application for users
 * of assistive technologies, such as screen readers.
 *
 * <div doc-module-components="ngAria"></div>
 *
 * ## Usage
 *
 * For ngAria to do its magic, simply include the module as a dependency. The directives supported
 * by ngAria are:
 * `ngModel`, `ngDisabled`, `ngShow`, `ngHide`, `ngClick`, `ngDblClick`, and `ngMessages`.
 *
 * Below is a more detailed breakdown of the attributes handled by ngAria:
 *
 * | Directive                                   | Supported Attributes                                                                   |
 * |---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 * | {@link ng.directive:ngModel ngModel}        | aria-checked, aria-valuemin, aria-valuemax, aria-valuenow, aria-invalid, aria-required |
 * | {@link ng.directive:ngDisabled ngDisabled}  | aria-disabled                                                                          |
 * | {@link ng.directive:ngShow ngShow}          | aria-hidden                                                                            |
 * | {@link ng.directive:ngHide ngHide}          | aria-hidden                                                                            |
 * | {@link ng.directive:ngClick ngClick}        | tabindex, keypress event                                                               |
 * | {@link ng.directive:ngDblclick ngDblclick}  | tabindex                                                                               |
 * | {@link module:ngMessages ngMessages}        | aria-live                                                                              |
 *
 * Find out more information about each directive by reading the
 * {@link guide/accessibility ngAria Developer Guide}.
 *
 * ##Example
 * Using ngDisabled with ngAria:
 * ```html
 * <md-checkbox ng-disabled="disabled">
 * ```
 * Becomes:
 * ```html
 * <md-checkbox ng-disabled="disabled" aria-disabled="true">
 * ```
 *
 * ##Disabling Attributes
 * It's possible to disable individual attributes added by ngAria with the
 * {@link ngAria.$ariaProvider#config config} method. For more details, see the
 * {@link guide/accessibility Developer Guide}.

   *
   * @description
   *
   * The $aria service contains helper methods for applying common
   * [ARIA](http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/) attributes to HTML directives.
   *
   * ngAria injects common accessibility attributes that tell assistive technologies when HTML
   * elements are enabled, selected, hidden, and more. To see how this is performed with ngAria,
   * let's review a code snippet from ngAria itself:
   *
   *```js
   * ngAriaModule.directive('ngDisabled', ['$aria', function($aria) {
   *   return $aria.$$watchExpr('ngDisabled', 'aria-disabled');
   * }])
   *```
   * Shown above, the ngAria module creates a directive with the same signature as the
   * traditional `ng-disabled` directive. But this ngAria version is dedicated to
   * solely managing accessibility attributes. The internal `$aria` service is used to watch the
   * boolean attribute `ngDisabled`. If it has not been explicitly set by the developer,
   * `aria-disabled` is injected as an attribute with its value synchronized to the value in
   * `ngDisabled`.
   *
   * Because ngAria hooks into the `ng-disabled` directive, developers do not have to do
   * anything to enable this feature. The `aria-disabled` attribute is automatically managed
   * simply as a silent side-effect of using `ng-disabled` with the ngAria module.
   *
   * The full list of directives that interface with ngAria:
   * * **ngModel**
   * * **ngShow**
   * * **ngHide**
   * * **ngClick**
   * * **ngDblclick**
   * * **ngMessages**
   * * **ngDisabled**
   *
   * Read the {@link guide/accessibility ngAria Developer Guide} for a thorough explanation of each
   * directive.
   *
   *
   * ## Dependencies
   * Requires the {@link ngAria} module to be installed.

 *
 *
 * <div doc-module-components="ngResource"></div>
 *
 * See {@link ngResource.$resource `$resource`} for usage.
 */

/**
 * @ngdoc service
 * @name $resource
 * @requires $http
 *
 * @description
 * A factory which creates a resource object that lets you interact with
 * [RESTful](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer) server-side data sources.
 *
 * The returned resource object has action methods which provide high-level behaviors without
 * the need to interact with the low level {@link ng.$http $http} service.
 *
 * Requires the {@link ngResource `ngResource`} module to be installed.
 *
 * By default, trailing slashes will be stripped from the calculated URLs,
 * which can pose problems with server backends that do not expect that
 * behavior.  This can be disabled by configuring the `$resourceProvider` like
 * this:
 *
 * ```js
     app.config(['$resourceProvider', function($resourceProvider) {
       // Don't strip trailing slashes from calculated URLs
       $resourceProvider.defaults.stripTrailingSlashes = false;
     }]);
 * ```
 *
 * @param {string} url A parametrized URL template with parameters prefixed by `:` as in
 *   `/user/:username`. If you are using a URL with a port number (e.g.
 *   `http://example.com:8080/api`), it will be respected.
 *
 *   If you are using a url with a suffix, just add the suffix, like this:
 *   `$resource('http://example.com/resource.json')` or `$resource('http://example.com/:id.json')`
 *   or even `$resource('http://example.com/resource/:resource_id.:format')`
 *   If the parameter before the suffix is empty, :resource_id in this case, then the `/.` will be
 *   collapsed down to a single `.`.  If you need this sequence to appear and not collapse then you
 *   can escape it with `/\.`.
 *
 * @param {Object=} paramDefaults Default values for `url` parameters. These can be overridden in
 *   `actions` methods. If any of the parameter value is a function, it will be executed every time
 *   when a param value needs to be obtained for a request (unless the param was overridden).
 *
 *   Each key value in the parameter object is first bound to url template if present and then any
 *   excess keys are appended to the url search query after the `?`.
 *
 *   Given a template `/path/:verb` and parameter `{verb:'greet', salutation:'Hello'}` results in
 *   URL `/path/greet?salutation=Hello`.
 *
 *   If the parameter value is prefixed with `@` then the value for that parameter will be extracted
 *   from the corresponding property on the `data` object (provided when calling an action method).  For
 *   example, if the `defaultParam` object is `{someParam: '@someProp'}` then the value of `someParam`
 *   will be `data.someProp`.
 *
 * @param {Object.<Object>=} actions Hash with declaration of custom actions that should extend
 *   the default set of resource actions. The declaration should be created in the format of {@link
 *   ng.$http#usage $http.config}:
 *
 *       {action1: {method:?, params:?, isArray:?, headers:?, ...},
 *        action2: {method:?, params:?, isArray:?, headers:?, ...},
 *        ...}
 *
 *   Where:
 *
 *   - **`action`** – {string} – The name of action. This name becomes the name of the method on
 *     your resource object.
 *   - **`method`** – {string} – Case insensitive HTTP method (e.g. `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`,
 *     `DELETE`, `JSONP`, etc).
 *   - **`params`** – {Object=} – Optional set of pre-bound parameters for this action. If any of
 *     the parameter value is a function, it will be executed every time when a param value needs to
 *     be obtained for a request (unless the param was overridden).
 *   - **`url`** – {string} – action specific `url` override. The url templating is supported just
 *     like for the resource-level urls.
 *   - **`isArray`** – {boolean=} – If true then the returned object for this action is an array,
 *     see `returns` section.
 *   - **`transformRequest`** –
 *     `{function(data, headersGetter)|Array.<function(data, headersGetter)>}` –
 *     transform function or an array of such functions. The transform function takes the http
 *     request body and headers and returns its transformed (typically serialized) version.
 *     By default, transformRequest will contain one function that checks if the request data is
 *     an object and serializes to using `angular.toJson`. To prevent this behavior, set
 *     `transformRequest` to an empty array: `transformRequest: []`
 *   - **`transformResponse`** –
 *     `{function(data, headersGetter)|Array.<function(data, headersGetter)>}` –
 *     transform function or an array of such functions. The transform function takes the http
 *     response body and headers and returns its transformed (typically deserialized) version.
 *     By default, transformResponse will contain one function that checks if the response looks like
 *     a JSON string and deserializes it using `angular.fromJson`. To prevent this behavior, set
 *     `transformResponse` to an empty array: `transformResponse: []`
 *   - **`cache`** – `{boolean|Cache}` – If true, a default $http cache will be used to cache the
 *     GET request, otherwise if a cache instance built with
 *     {@link ng.$cacheFactory $cacheFactory}, this cache will be used for
 *     caching.
 *   - **`timeout`** – `{number|Promise}` – timeout in milliseconds, or {@link ng.$q promise} that
 *     should abort the request when resolved.
 *   - **`withCredentials`** - `{boolean}` - whether to set the `withCredentials` flag on the
 *     XHR object. See
 *     [requests with credentials](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/http_access_control#section_5)
 *     for more information.
 *   - **`responseType`** - `{string}` - see
 *     [requestType](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/XMLHttpRequest#responseType).
 *   - **`interceptor`** - `{Object=}` - The interceptor object has two optional methods -
 *     `response` and `responseError`. Both `response` and `responseError` interceptors get called
 *     with `http response` object. See {@link ng.$http $http interceptors}.
 *
 * @param {Object} options Hash with custom settings that should extend the
 *   default `$resourceProvider` behavior.  The only supported option is
 *
 *   Where:
 *
 *   - **`stripTrailingSlashes`** – {boolean} – If true then the trailing
 *   slashes from any calculated URL will be stripped. (Defaults to true.)
 *
 * @returns {Object} A resource "class" object with methods for the default set of resource actions
 *   optionally extended with custom `actions`. The default set contains these actions:
 *   ```js
 *   { 'get':    {method:'GET'},
 *     'save':   {method:'POST'},
 *     'query':  {method:'GET', isArray:true},
 *     'remove': {method:'DELETE'},
 *     'delete': {method:'DELETE'} };
 *   ```
 *
 *   Calling these methods invoke an {@link ng.$http} with the specified http method,
 *   destination and parameters. When the data is returned from the server then the object is an
 *   instance of the resource class. The actions `save`, `remove` and `delete` are available on it
 *   as  methods with the `$` prefix. This allows you to easily perform CRUD operations (create,
 *   read, update, delete) on server-side data like this:
 *   ```js
 *   var User = $resource('/user/:userId', {userId:'@id'});
 *   var user = User.get({userId:123}, function() {
 *     user.abc = true;
 *     user.$save();
 *   });
 *   ```
 *
 *   It is important to realize that invoking a $resource object method immediately returns an
 *   empty reference (object or array depending on `isArray`). Once the data is returned from the
 *   server the existing reference is populated with the actual data. This is a useful trick since
 *   usually the resource is assigned to a model which is then rendered by the view. Having an empty
 *   object results in no rendering, once the data arrives from the server then the object is
 *   populated with the data and the view automatically re-renders itself showing the new data. This
 *   means that in most cases one never has to write a callback function for the action methods.
 *
 *   The action methods on the class object or instance object can be invoked with the following
 *   parameters:
 *
 *   - HTTP GET "class" actions: `Resource.action([parameters], [success], [error])`
 *   - non-GET "class" actions: `Resource.action([parameters], postData, [success], [error])`
 *   - non-GET instance actions:  `instance.$action([parameters], [success], [error])`
 *
 *   Success callback is called with (value, responseHeaders) arguments. Error callback is called
 *   with (httpResponse) argument.
 *
 *   Class actions return empty instance (with additional properties below).
 *   Instance actions return promise of the action.
 *
 *   The Resource instances and collection have these additional properties:
 *
 *   - `$promise`: the {@link ng.$q promise} of the original server interaction that created this
 *     instance or collection.
 *
 *     On success, the promise is resolved with the same resource instance or collection object,
 *     updated with data from server. This makes it easy to use in
 *     {@link ngRoute.$routeProvider resolve section of $routeProvider.when()} to defer view
 *     rendering until the resource(s) are loaded.
 *
 *     On failure, the promise is resolved with the {@link ng.$http http response} object, without
 *     the `resource` property.
 *
 *     If an interceptor object was provided, the promise will instead be resolved with the value
 *     returned by the interceptor.
 *
 *   - `$resolved`: `true` after first server interaction is completed (either with success or
 *      rejection), `false` before that. Knowing if the Resource has been resolved is useful in
 *      data-binding.
 *
 * @example
 *
 * # Credit card resource
 *
 * ```js
     // Define CreditCard class
     var CreditCard = $resource('/user/:userId/card/:cardId',
      {userId:123, cardId:'@id'}, {
       charge: {method:'POST', params:{charge:true}}
      });

     // We can retrieve a collection from the server
     var cards = CreditCard.query(function() {
       // GET: /user/123/card
       // server returns: [ {id:456, number:'1234', name:'Smith'} ];

       var card = cards[0];
       // each item is an instance of CreditCard
       expect(card instanceof CreditCard).toEqual(true);
       card.name = "J. Smith";
       // non GET methods are mapped onto the instances
       card.$save();
       // POST: /user/123/card/456 {id:456, number:'1234', name:'J. Smith'}
       // server returns: {id:456, number:'1234', name: 'J. Smith'};

       // our custom method is mapped as well.
       card.$charge({amount:9.99});
       // POST: /user/123/card/456?amount=9.99&charge=true {id:456, number:'1234', name:'J. Smith'}
     });

     // we can create an instance as well
     var newCard = new CreditCard({number:'0123'});
     newCard.name = "Mike Smith";
     newCard.$save();
     // POST: /user/123/card {number:'0123', name:'Mike Smith'}
     // server returns: {id:789, number:'0123', name: 'Mike Smith'};
     expect(newCard.id).toEqual(789);
 * ```
 *
 * The object returned from this function execution is a resource "class" which has "static" method
 * for each action in the definition.
 *
 * Calling these methods invoke `$http` on the `url` template with the given `method`, `params` and
 * `headers`.
 * When the data is returned from the server then the object is an instance of the resource type and
 * all of the non-GET methods are available with `$` prefix. This allows you to easily support CRUD
 * operations (create, read, update, delete) on server-side data.

   ```js
     var User = $resource('/user/:userId', {userId:'@id'});
     User.get({userId:123}, function(user) {
       user.abc = true;
       user.$save();
     });
   ```
 *
 * It's worth noting that the success callback for `get`, `query` and other methods gets passed
 * in the response that came from the server as well as $http header getter function, so one
 * could rewrite the above example and get access to http headers as:
 *
   ```js
     var User = $resource('/user/:userId', {userId:'@id'});
     User.get({userId:123}, function(u, getResponseHeaders){
       u.abc = true;
       u.$save(function(u, putResponseHeaders) {
         //u => saved user object
         //putResponseHeaders => $http header getter
       });
     });
   ```
 *
 * You can also access the raw `$http` promise via the `$promise` property on the object returned
 *
   ```
     var User = $resource('/user/:userId', {userId:'@id'});
     User.get({userId:123})
         .$promise.then(function(user) {
           $scope.user = user;
         });
   ```

 * # Creating a custom 'PUT' request
 * In this example we create a custom method on our resource to make a PUT request
 * ```js
 *    var app = angular.module('app', ['ngResource', 'ngRoute']);
 *
 *    // Some APIs expect a PUT request in the format URL/object/ID
 *    // Here we are creating an 'update' method
 *    app.factory('Notes', ['$resource', function($resource) {
 *    return $resource('/notes/:id', null,
 *        {
 *            'update': { method:'PUT' }
 *        });
 *    }]);
 *
 *    // In our controller we get the ID from the URL using ngRoute and $routeParams
 *    // We pass in $routeParams and our Notes factory along with $scope
 *    app.controller('NotesCtrl', ['$scope', '$routeParams', 'Notes',
                                      function($scope, $routeParams, Notes) {
 *    // First get a note object from the factory
 *    var note = Notes.get({ id:$routeParams.id });
 *    $id = note.id;
 *
 *    // Now call update passing in the ID first then the object you are updating
 *    Notes.update({ id:$id }, note);
 *
 *    // This will PUT /notes/ID with the note object in the request payload
 *    }]);
 * ```

/**
 * @ngdoc service
 * @name $sanitize
 * @kind function
 *
 * @description
 *   The input is sanitized by parsing the HTML into tokens. All safe tokens (from a whitelist) are
 *   then serialized back to properly escaped html string. This means that no unsafe input can make
 *   it into the returned string, however, since our parser is more strict than a typical browser
 *   parser, it's possible that some obscure input, which would be recognized as valid HTML by a
 *   browser, won't make it through the sanitizer. The input may also contain SVG markup.
 *   The whitelist is configured using the functions `aHrefSanitizationWhitelist` and
 *   `imgSrcSanitizationWhitelist` of {@link ng.$compileProvider `$compileProvider`}.
 *
 * @param {string} html HTML input.
 * @returns {string} Sanitized HTML.

     * object containing event handlers.
     * The pointer types that should be used can be specified via the optional
     * third argument, which is an array of strings `'mouse'` and `'touch'`. By default,
     * `$swipe` will listen for `mouse` and `touch` events.
     *
     * The four events are `start`, `move`, `end`, and `cancel`. `start`, `move`, and `end`
     * receive as a parameter a coordinates object of the form `{ x: 150, y: 310 }`.
     *
     * `start` is called on either `mousedown` or `touchstart`. After this event, `$swipe` is
     * watching for `touchmove` or `mousemove` events. These events are ignored until the total
     * distance moved in either dimension exceeds a small threshold.
     *
     * Once this threshold is exceeded, either the horizontal or vertical delta is greater.
     * - If the horizontal distance is greater, this is a swipe and `move` and `end` events follow.
     * - If the vertical distance is greater, this is a scroll, and we let the browser take over.
     *   A `cancel` event is sent.
     *
     * `move` is called on `mousemove` and `touchmove` after the above logic has determined that
     * a swipe is in progress.
     *
     * `end` is called when a swipe is successfully completed with a `touchend` or `mouseup`.
     *
     * `cancel` is called either on a `touchcancel` from the browser, or when we begin scrolling
     * as described above.

  // TAP EVENTS AND GHOST CLICKS
  //
  // Why tap events?
  // Mobile browsers detect a tap, then wait a moment (usually ~300ms) to see if you're
  // double-tapping, and then fire a click event.
  //
  // This delay sucks and makes mobile apps feel unresponsive.
  // So we detect touchstart, touchmove, touchcancel and touchend ourselves and determine when
  // the user has tapped on something.
  //
  // What happens when the browser then generates a click event?
  // The browser, of course, also detects the tap and fires a click after a delay. This results in
  // tapping/clicking twice. We do "clickbusting" to prevent it.
  //
  // How does it work?
  // We attach global touchstart and click handlers, that run during the capture (early) phase.
  // So the sequence for a tap is:
  // - global touchstart: Sets an "allowable region" at the point touched.
  // - element's touchstart: Starts a touch
  // (- touchmove or touchcancel ends the touch, no click follows)
  // - element's touchend: Determines if the tap is valid (didn't move too far away, didn't hold
  //   too long) and fires the user's tap handler. The touchend also calls preventGhostClick().
  // - preventGhostClick() removes the allowable region the global touchstart created.
  // - The browser generates a click event.
  // - The global click handler catches the click, and checks whether it was in an allowable region.
  //     - If preventGhostClick was called, the region will have been removed, the click is busted.
  //     - If the region is still there, the click proceeds normally. Therefore clicks on links and
  //       other elements without ngTap on them work normally.
  //
  // This is an ugly, terrible hack!
  // Yeah, tell me about it. The alternatives are using the slow click events, or making our users
  // deal with the ghost clicks, so I consider this the least of evils. Fortunately Angular
  // encapsulates this ugly logic away from the user.
  //
  // Why not just put click handlers on the element?
  // We do that too, just to be sure. If the tap event caused the DOM to change,
  // it is possible another element is now in that position. To take account for these possibly
  // distinct elements, the handlers are global and care only about coordinates.

  // Checks if the coordinates are close enough to be within the region.

 * @ngdoc directive

 *
 * @element ANY
 * @param {angular.Module} ngApp an optional application
 *   {@link angular.module module} name to load.
 * @param {boolean=} ngStrictDi if this attribute is present on the app element, the injector will be
 *   created in "strict-di" mode. This means that the application will fail to invoke functions which
 *   do not use explicit function annotation (and are thus unsuitable for minification), as described
 *   in {@link guide/di the Dependency Injection guide}, and useful debugging info will assist in
 *   tracking down the root of these bugs.
 *
 * @description
 *
 * Use this directive to **auto-bootstrap** an AngularJS application. The `ngApp` directive
 * designates the **root element** of the application and is typically placed near the root element
 * of the page - e.g. on the `<body>` or `<html>` tags.
 *
 * Only one AngularJS application can be auto-bootstrapped per HTML document. The first `ngApp`
 * found in the document will be used to define the root element to auto-bootstrap as an
 * application. To run multiple applications in an HTML document you must manually bootstrap them using
 * {@link angular.bootstrap} instead. AngularJS applications cannot be nested within each other.
 *
 * You can specify an **AngularJS module** to be used as the root module for the application.  This
 * module will be loaded into the {@link auto.$injector} when the application is bootstrapped and
 * should contain the application code needed or have dependencies on other modules that will
 * contain the code. See {@link angular.module} for more information.
 *
 * In the example below if the `ngApp` directive were not placed on the `html` element then the
 * document would not be compiled, the `AppController` would not be instantiated and the `{{ a+b }}`
 * would not be resolved to `3`.
 *
 * `ngApp` is the easiest, and most common, way to bootstrap an application.
 *
 <example module="ngAppDemo">
   <file name="index.html">
   <div ng-controller="ngAppDemoController">
     I can add: {{a}} + {{b}} =  {{ a+b }}
   </div>
   </file>
   <file name="script.js">
   angular.module('ngAppDemo', []).controller('ngAppDemoController', function($scope) {
     $scope.a = 1;
     $scope.b = 2;
   });
   </file>
 </example>
 *
 * Using `ngStrictDi`, you would see something like this:
 *
 <example ng-app-included="true">
   <file name="index.html">
   <div ng-app="ngAppStrictDemo" ng-strict-di>
       <div ng-controller="GoodController1">
           I can add: {{a}} + {{b}} =  {{ a+b }}

           <p>This renders because the controller does not fail to
              instantiate, by using explicit annotation style (see
              script.js for details)
           </p>
       </div>

       <div ng-controller="GoodController2">
           Name: <input ng-model="name"><br />
           Hello, {{name}}!

           <p>This renders because the controller does not fail to
              instantiate, by using explicit annotation style
              (see script.js for details)

           I can add: {{a}} + {{b}} =  {{ a+b }}

           <p>The controller could not be instantiated, due to relying

     *
     * The `angular.module` is a global place for creating, registering and retrieving Angular
     * modules.
     * All modules (angular core or 3rd party) that should be available to an application must be
     * registered using this mechanism.
     *
     * When passed two or more arguments, a new module is created.  If passed only one argument, an
     * existing module (the name passed as the first argument to `module`) is retrieved.
     *
     *
     * # Module
     *
     * A module is a collection of services, directives, controllers, filters, and configuration information.
     * `angular.module` is used to configure the {@link auto.$injector $injector}.
     *
     * ```js
     * // Create a new module
     * var myModule = angular.module('myModule', []);
     *
     * // register a new service
     * myModule.value('appName', 'MyCoolApp');
     *
     * // configure existing services inside initialization blocks.
     * myModule.config(['$locationProvider', function($locationProvider) {
     *   // Configure existing providers
     *   $locationProvider.hashPrefix('!');
     * }]);
     * ```
     *
     * Then you can create an injector and load your modules like this:
     *
     * ```js
     * var injector = angular.injector(['ng', 'myModule'])
     * ```
     *
     * However it's more likely that you'll just use
     * {@link ng.directive:ngApp ngApp} or
     * {@link angular.bootstrap} to simplify this process for you.
     *
     * @param {!string} name The name of the module to create or retrieve.
     * @param {!Array.<string>=} requires If specified then new module is being created. If
     *        unspecified then the module is being retrieved for further configuration.
     * @param {Function=} configFn Optional configuration function for the module. Same as
     *        {@link angular.Module#config Module#config()}.
     * @returns {module} new module with the {@link angular.Module} api.

/**
 * @ngdoc function
 * @name angular.element
 * @module ng
 * @kind function
 *
 * @description
 * Wraps a raw DOM element or HTML string as a [jQuery](http://jquery.com) element.
 *
 * If jQuery is available, `angular.element` is an alias for the
 * [jQuery](http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/) function. If jQuery is not available, `angular.element`
 * delegates to Angular's built-in subset of jQuery, called "jQuery lite" or "jqLite."
 *
 * <div class="alert alert-success">jqLite is a tiny, API-compatible subset of jQuery that allows
 * Angular to manipulate the DOM in a cross-browser compatible way. **jqLite** implements only the most
 * commonly needed functionality with the goal of having a very small footprint.</div>
 *
 * To use jQuery, simply load it before `DOMContentLoaded` event fired.
 *
 * <div class="alert">**Note:** all element references in Angular are always wrapped with jQuery or
 * jqLite; they are never raw DOM references.</div>
 *
 * ## Angular's jqLite
 * jqLite provides only the following jQuery methods:
 *
 * - [`addClass()`](http://api.jquery.com/addClass/)
 * - [`after()`](http://api.jquery.com/after/)
 * - [`append()`](http://api.jquery.com/append/)
 * - [`attr()`](http://api.jquery.com/attr/) - Does not support functions as parameters
 * - [`bind()`](http://api.jquery.com/bind/) - Does not support namespaces, selectors or eventData
 * - [`children()`](http://api.jquery.com/children/) - Does not support selectors
 * - [`clone()`](http://api.jquery.com/clone/)
 * - [`contents()`](http://api.jquery.com/contents/)
 * - [`css()`](http://api.jquery.com/css/) - Only retrieves inline-styles, does not call `getComputedStyle()`
 * - [`data()`](http://api.jquery.com/data/)
 * - [`detach()`](http://api.jquery.com/detach/)
 * - [`empty()`](http://api.jquery.com/empty/)
 * - [`eq()`](http://api.jquery.com/eq/)
 * - [`find()`](http://api.jquery.com/find/) - Limited to lookups by tag name
 * - [`hasClass()`](http://api.jquery.com/hasClass/)
 * - [`html()`](http://api.jquery.com/html/)
 * - [`next()`](http://api.jquery.com/next/) - Does not support selectors
 * - [`on()`](http://api.jquery.com/on/) - Does not support namespaces, selectors or eventData
 * - [`off()`](http://api.jquery.com/off/) - Does not support namespaces or selectors
 * - [`one()`](http://api.jquery.com/one/) - Does not support namespaces or selectors
 * - [`parent()`](http://api.jquery.com/parent/) - Does not support selectors
 * - [`prepend()`](http://api.jquery.com/prepend/)
 * - [`prop()`](http://api.jquery.com/prop/)
 * - [`ready()`](http://api.jquery.com/ready/)
 * - [`remove()`](http://api.jquery.com/remove/)
 * - [`removeAttr()`](http://api.jquery.com/removeAttr/)
 * - [`removeClass()`](http://api.jquery.com/removeClass/)
 * - [`removeData()`](http://api.jquery.com/removeData/)
 * - [`replaceWith()`](http://api.jquery.com/replaceWith/)
 * - [`text()`](http://api.jquery.com/text/)
 * - [`toggleClass()`](http://api.jquery.com/toggleClass/)
 * - [`triggerHandler()`](http://api.jquery.com/triggerHandler/) - Passes a dummy event object to handlers.
 * - [`unbind()`](http://api.jquery.com/unbind/) - Does not support namespaces
 * - [`val()`](http://api.jquery.com/val/)
 * - [`wrap()`](http://api.jquery.com/wrap/)
 *
 * ## jQuery/jqLite Extras
 * Angular also provides the following additional methods and events to both jQuery and jqLite:
 *
 * ### Events
 * - `$destroy` - AngularJS intercepts all jqLite/jQuery's DOM destruction apis and fires this event
 *    on all DOM nodes being removed.  This can be used to clean up any 3rd party bindings to the DOM
 *    element before it is removed.
 *
 * ### Methods
 * - `controller(name)` - retrieves the controller of the current element or its parent. By default
 *   retrieves controller associated with the `ngController` directive. If `name` is provided as
 *   camelCase directive name, then the controller for this directive will be retrieved (e.g.
 *   `'ngModel'`).
 * - `injector()` - retrieves the injector of the current element or its parent.
 * - `scope()` - retrieves the {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope scope} of the current
 *   element or its parent. Requires {@link guide/production#disabling-debug-data Debug Data} to
 *   be enabled.
 * - `isolateScope()` - retrieves an isolate {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope scope} if one is attached directly to the
 *   current element. This getter should be used only on elements that contain a directive which starts a new isolate
 *   scope. Calling `scope()` on this element always returns the original non-isolate scope.
 *   Requires {@link guide/production#disabling-debug-data Debug Data} to be enabled.
 * - `inheritedData()` - same as `data()`, but walks up the DOM until a value is found or the top
 *   parent element is reached.
 *
 * @param {string|DOMElement} element HTML string or DOMElement to be wrapped into jQuery.
 * @returns {Object} jQuery object.

 * @description
 * Creates an injector object that can be used for retrieving services as well as for
 * dependency injection (see {@link guide/di dependency injection}).
 *
 * @param {Array.<string|Function>} modules A list of module functions or their aliases. See
 *     {@link angular.module}. The `ng` module must be explicitly added.
 * @param {boolean=} [strictDi=false] Whether the injector should be in strict mode, which
 *     disallows argument name annotation inference.
 * @returns {injector} Injector object. See {@link auto.$injector $injector}.
 *
 * @example
 * Typical usage
 * ```js
 *   // create an injector
 *   var $injector = angular.injector(['ng']);
 *
 *   // use the injector to kick off your application
 *   // use the type inference to auto inject arguments, or use implicit injection
 *   $injector.invoke(function($rootScope, $compile, $document) {
 *     $compile($document)($rootScope);
 *     $rootScope.$digest();
 *   });
 * ```
 *
 * Sometimes you want to get access to the injector of a currently running Angular app
 * from outside Angular. Perhaps, you want to inject and compile some markup after the
 * application has been bootstrapped. You can do this using the extra `injector()` added
 * to JQuery/jqLite elements. See {@link angular.element}.
 *
 * *This is fairly rare but could be the case if a third party library is injecting the
 * markup.*
 *
 * In the following example a new block of HTML containing a `ng-controller`
 * directive is added to the end of the document body by JQuery. We then compile and link
 * it into the current AngularJS scope.
 *
 * ```js
 * var $div = $('<div ng-controller="MyCtrl">{{content.label}}</div>');
 * $(document.body).append($div);
 *
 * angular.element(document).injector().invoke(function($compile) {
 *   var scope = angular.element($div).scope();
 *   $compile($div)(scope);

 *
 * `$injector` is used to retrieve object instances as defined by

 *

 *
 * # Injection Function Annotation
 *
 * JavaScript does not have annotations, and annotations are needed for dependency injection. The
 * following are all valid ways of annotating function with injection arguments and are equivalent.
 *
 * ```js
 *   // inferred (only works if code not minified/obfuscated)
 *   $injector.invoke(function(serviceA){});
 *
 *   // annotated
 *   function explicit(serviceA) {};
 *   explicit.$inject = ['serviceA'];
 *   $injector.invoke(explicit);
 *
 *   // inline
 *   $injector.invoke(['serviceA', function(serviceA){}]);
 * ```
 *
 * ## Inference
 *
 * In JavaScript calling `toString()` on a function returns the function definition. The definition
 * can then be parsed and the function arguments can be extracted. This method of discovering
 * annotations is disallowed when the injector is in strict mode.
 * *NOTE:* This does not work with minification, and obfuscation tools since these tools change the
 * argument names.
 *
 * ## `$inject` Annotation
 * By adding an `$inject` property onto a function the injection parameters can be specified.
 *
 * ## Inline
 * As an array of injection names, where the last item in the array is the function to call.

/**
 * @ngdoc method
 * @name $injector#annotate
 *
 * @description
 * Returns an array of service names which the function is requesting for injection. This API is
 * used by the injector to determine which services need to be injected into the function when the
 * function is invoked. There are three ways in which the function can be annotated with the needed
 * dependencies.
 *
 * # Argument names
 *
 * The simplest form is to extract the dependencies from the arguments of the function. This is done
 * by converting the function into a string using `toString()` method and extracting the argument
 * names.
 * ```js
 *   // Given
 *   function MyController($scope, $route) {
 *     // ...
 *   }
 *
 *   // Then
 *   expect(injector.annotate(MyController)).toEqual(['$scope', '$route']);
 * ```
 *
 * You can disallow this method by using strict injection mode.
 *
 * This method does not work with code minification / obfuscation. For this reason the following
 * annotation strategies are supported.
 *
 * # The `$inject` property
 *
 * If a function has an `$inject` property and its value is an array of strings, then the strings
 * represent names of services to be injected into the function.
 * ```js
 *   // Given
 *   var MyController = function(obfuscatedScope, obfuscatedRoute) {
 *     // ...
 *   }
 *   // Define function dependencies
 *   MyController['$inject'] = ['$scope', '$route'];
 *
 *   // Then
 *   expect(injector.annotate(MyController)).toEqual(['$scope', '$route']);
 * ```
 *
 * # The array notation
 *
 * It is often desirable to inline Injected functions and that's when setting the `$inject` property
 * is very inconvenient. In these situations using the array notation to specify the dependencies in
 * a way that survives minification is a better choice:
 *
 * ```js
 *   // We wish to write this (not minification / obfuscation safe)
 *   injector.invoke(function($compile, $rootScope) {
 *     // ...
 *   });
 *
 *   // We are forced to write break inlining
 *   var tmpFn = function(obfuscatedCompile, obfuscatedRootScope) {
 *     // ...
 *   };
 *   tmpFn.$inject = ['$compile', '$rootScope'];
 *   injector.invoke(tmpFn);
 *
 *   // To better support inline function the inline annotation is supported
 *   injector.invoke(['$compile', '$rootScope', function(obfCompile, obfRootScope) {
 *     // ...
 *   }]);
 *
 *   // Therefore
 *   expect(injector.annotate(
 *      ['$compile', '$rootScope', function(obfus_$compile, obfus_$rootScope) {}])
 *    ).toEqual(['$compile', '$rootScope']);
 * ```
 *
 * @param {Function|Array.<string|Function>} fn Function for which dependent service names need to
 * be retrieved as described above.

 * @param {boolean=} [strictDi=false] Disallow argument name annotation inference.

/**
 * @ngdoc service
 * @name $provide
 *
 * @description
 *
 * The {@link auto.$provide $provide} service has a number of methods for registering components
 * with the {@link auto.$injector $injector}. Many of these functions are also exposed on
 * {@link angular.Module}.
 *
 * An Angular **service** is a singleton object created by a **service factory**.  These **service
 * factories** are functions which, in turn, are created by a **service provider**.
 * The **service providers** are constructor functions. When instantiated they must contain a
 * property called `$get`, which holds the **service factory** function.
 *
 * When you request a service, the {@link auto.$injector $injector} is responsible for finding the
 * correct **service provider**, instantiating it and then calling its `$get` **service factory**
 * function to get the instance of the **service**.
 *
 * Often services have no configuration options and there is no need to add methods to the service
 * provider.  The provider will be no more than a constructor function with a `$get` property. For
 * these cases the {@link auto.$provide $provide} service has additional helper methods to register
 * services without specifying a provider.
 *
 * * {@link auto.$provide#provider provider(provider)} - registers a **service provider** with the
 *     {@link auto.$injector $injector}
 * * {@link auto.$provide#constant constant(obj)} - registers a value/object that can be accessed by
 *     providers and services.
 * * {@link auto.$provide#value value(obj)} - registers a value/object that can only be accessed by
 *     services, not providers.
 * * {@link auto.$provide#factory factory(fn)} - registers a service **factory function**, `fn`,
 *     that will be wrapped in a **service provider** object, whose `$get` property will contain the
 *     given factory function.
 * * {@link auto.$provide#service service(class)} - registers a **constructor function**, `class`
 *     that will be wrapped in a **service provider** object, whose `$get` property will instantiate
 *      a new object using the given constructor function.
 *
 * See the individual methods for more information and examples.

/**
 * @ngdoc method
 * @name $provide#provider
 * @description
 *
 * Register a **provider function** with the {@link auto.$injector $injector}. Provider functions
 * are constructor functions, whose instances are responsible for "providing" a factory for a
 * service.
 *
 * Service provider names start with the name of the service they provide followed by `Provider`.
 * For example, the {@link ng.$log $log} service has a provider called
 * {@link ng.$logProvider $logProvider}.
 *
 * Service provider objects can have additional methods which allow configuration of the provider
 * and its service. Importantly, you can configure what kind of service is created by the `$get`
 * method, or how that service will act. For example, the {@link ng.$logProvider $logProvider} has a
 * method {@link ng.$logProvider#debugEnabled debugEnabled}
 * which lets you specify whether the {@link ng.$log $log} service will log debug messages to the
 * console or not.
 *
 * @param {string} name The name of the instance. NOTE: the provider will be available under `name +
                        'Provider'` key.
 * @param {(Object|function())} provider If the provider is:
 *
 *   - `Object`: then it should have a `$get` method. The `$get` method will be invoked using
 *     {@link auto.$injector#invoke $injector.invoke()} when an instance needs to be created.
 *   - `Constructor`: a new instance of the provider will be created using
 *     {@link auto.$injector#instantiate $injector.instantiate()}, then treated as `object`.
 *
 * @returns {Object} registered provider instance

 * @example
 *
 * The following example shows how to create a simple event tracking service and register it using
 * {@link auto.$provide#provider $provide.provider()}.
 *
 * ```js
 *  // Define the eventTracker provider
 *  function EventTrackerProvider() {
 *    var trackingUrl = '/track';

   * @ngdoc service

   * @kind function
   * @requires $window
   * @requires $location
   * @requires $rootScope
   *
   * @description
   * When called, it checks the current value of {@link ng.$location#hash $location.hash()} and
   * scrolls to the related element, according to the rules specified in the
   * [Html5 spec](http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#the-indicated-part-of-the-document).
   *
   * It also watches the {@link ng.$location#hash $location.hash()} and automatically scrolls to
   * match any anchor whenever it changes. This can be disabled by calling
   * {@link ng.$anchorScrollProvider#disableAutoScrolling $anchorScrollProvider.disableAutoScrolling()}.
   *
   * Additionally, you can use its {@link ng.$anchorScroll#yOffset yOffset} property to specify a
   * vertical scroll-offset (either fixed or dynamic).
   *
   * @property {(number|function|jqLite)} yOffset
   * If set, specifies a vertical scroll-offset. This is often useful when there are fixed
   * positioned elements at the top of the page, such as navbars, headers etc.
   *
   * `yOffset` can be specified in various ways:
   * - **number**: A fixed number of pixels to be used as offset.<br /><br />
   * - **function**: A getter function called everytime `$anchorScroll()` is executed. Must return
   *   a number representing the offset (in pixels).<br /><br />
   * - **jqLite**: A jqLite/jQuery element to be used for specifying the offset. The distance from
   *   the top of the page to the element's bottom will be used as offset.<br />
   *   **Note**: The element will be taken into account only as long as its `position` is set to
   *   `fixed`. This option is useful, when dealing with responsive navbars/headers that adjust
   *   their height and/or positioning according to the viewport's size.
   *
   * <br />
   * <div class="alert alert-warning">
   * In order for `yOffset` to work properly, scrolling should take place on the document's root and
   * not some child element.

 * The compilation is a process of walking the DOM tree and matching DOM elements to

 * <div class="alert alert-warning">
 * **Note:** This document is an in-depth reference of all directive options.
 * For a gentle introduction to directives with examples of common use cases,
 * see the {@link guide/directive directive guide}.
 * </div>
 *
 * ## Comprehensive Directive API
 *
 * There are many different options for a directive.
 *
 * The difference resides in the return value of the factory function.
 * You can either return a "Directive Definition Object" (see below) that defines the directive properties,
 * or just the `postLink` function (all other properties will have the default values).
 *
 * <div class="alert alert-success">
 * **Best Practice:** It's recommended to use the "directive definition object" form.
 * </div>
 *
 * Here's an example directive declared with a Directive Definition Object:
 *
 * ```js
 *   var myModule = angular.module(...);
 *
 *   myModule.directive('directiveName', function factory(injectables) {
 *     var directiveDefinitionObject = {
 *       priority: 0,
 *       template: '<div></div>', // or // function(tElement, tAttrs) { ... },
 *       // or
 *       // templateUrl: 'directive.html', // or // function(tElement, tAttrs) { ... },
 *       transclude: false,
 *       restrict: 'A',
 *       templateNamespace: 'html',
 *       scope: false,
 *       controller: function($scope, $element, $attrs, $transclude, otherInjectables) { ... },
 *       controllerAs: 'stringAlias',
 *       require: 'siblingDirectiveName', // or // ['^parentDirectiveName', '?optionalDirectiveName', '?^optionalParent'],
 *       compile: function compile(tElement, tAttrs, transclude) {
 *         return {
 *           pre: function preLink(scope, iElement, iAttrs, controller) { ... },
 *           post: function postLink(scope, iElement, iAttrs, controller) { ... }
 *         }
 *         // or
 *         // return function postLink( ... ) { ... }
 *       },
 *       // or
 *       // link: {
 *       //  pre: function preLink(scope, iElement, iAttrs, controller) { ... },
 *       //  post: function postLink(scope, iElement, iAttrs, controller) { ... }
 *       // }
 *       // or
 *       // link: function postLink( ... ) { ... }
 *     };
 *     return directiveDefinitionObject;
 *   });
 * ```
 *
 * <div class="alert alert-warning">
 * **Note:** Any unspecified options will use the default value. You can see the default values below.
 * </div>
 *
 * Therefore the above can be simplified as:
 *
 * ```js
 *   var myModule = angular.module(...);
 *
 *   myModule.directive('directiveName', function factory(injectables) {
 *     var directiveDefinitionObject = {
 *       link: function postLink(scope, iElement, iAttrs) { ... }
 *     };
 *     return directiveDefinitionObject;
 *     // or
 *     // return function postLink(scope, iElement, iAttrs) { ... }
 *   });
 * ```
 *
 *
 *
 * ### Directive Definition Object
 *
 * The directive definition object provides instructions to the {@link ng.$compile
 * compiler}. The attributes are:
 *
 * #### `multiElement`
 * When this property is set to true, the HTML compiler will collect DOM nodes between
 * nodes with the attributes `directive-name-start` and `directive-name-end`, and group them
 * together as the directive elements. It is recommended that this feature be used on directives
 * which are not strictly behavioural (such as {@link ngClick}), and which
 * do not manipulate or replace child nodes (such as {@link ngInclude}).
 *
 * #### `priority`
 * When there are multiple directives defined on a single DOM element, sometimes it
 * is necessary to specify the order in which the directives are applied. The `priority` is used
 * to sort the directives before their `compile` functions get called. Priority is defined as a
 * number. Directives with greater numerical `priority` are compiled first. Pre-link functions
 * are also run in priority order, but post-link functions are run in reverse order. The order
 * of directives with the same priority is undefined. The default priority is `0`.
 *
 * #### `terminal`
 * If set to true then the current `priority` will be the last set of directives
 * which will execute (any directives at the current priority will still execute
 * as the order of execution on same `priority` is undefined). Note that expressions
 * and other directives used in the directive's template will also be excluded from execution.
 *
 * #### `scope`
 * **If set to `true`,** then a new scope will be created for this directive. If multiple directives on the
 * same element request a new scope, only one new scope is created. The new scope rule does not
 * apply for the root of the template since the root of the template always gets a new scope.
 *
 * **If set to `{}` (object hash),** then a new "isolate" scope is created. The 'isolate' scope differs from
 * normal scope in that it does not prototypically inherit from the parent scope. This is useful
 * when creating reusable components, which should not accidentally read or modify data in the
 * parent scope.
 *
 * The 'isolate' scope takes an object hash which defines a set of local scope properties
 * derived from the parent scope. These local properties are useful for aliasing values for
 * templates. Locals definition is a hash of local scope property to its source:
 *
 * * `@` or `@attr` - bind a local scope property to the value of DOM attribute. The result is
 *   always a string since DOM attributes are strings. If no `attr` name is specified  then the
 *   attribute name is assumed to be the same as the local name.
 *   Given `<widget my-attr="hello {{name}}">` and widget definition
 *   of `scope: { localName:'@myAttr' }`, then widget scope property `localName` will reflect
 *   the interpolated value of `hello {{name}}`. As the `name` attribute changes so will the
 *   `localName` property on the widget scope. The `name` is read from the parent scope (not
 *   component scope).
 *
 * * `=` or `=attr` - set up bi-directional binding between a local scope property and the
 *   parent scope property of name defined via the value of the `attr` attribute. If no `attr`
 *   name is specified then the attribute name is assumed to be the same as the local name.
 *   Given `<widget my-attr="parentModel">` and widget definition of
 *   `scope: { localModel:'=myAttr' }`, then widget scope property `localModel` will reflect the
 *   value of `parentModel` on the parent scope. Any changes to `parentModel` will be reflected
 *   in `localModel` and any changes in `localModel` will reflect in `parentModel`. If the parent
 *   scope property doesn't exist, it will throw a NON_ASSIGNABLE_MODEL_EXPRESSION exception. You
 *   can avoid this behavior using `=?` or `=?attr` in order to flag the property as optional. If
 *   you want to shallow watch for changes (i.e. $watchCollection instead of $watch) you can use
 *   `=*` or `=*attr` (`=*?` or `=*?attr` if the property is optional).
 *
 * * `&` or `&attr` - provides a way to execute an expression in the context of the parent scope.
 *   If no `attr` name is specified then the attribute name is assumed to be the same as the
 *   local name. Given `<widget my-attr="count = count + value">` and widget definition of
 *   `scope: { localFn:'&myAttr' }`, then isolate scope property `localFn` will point to
 *   a function wrapper for the `count = count + value` expression. Often it's desirable to
 *   pass data from the isolated scope via an expression to the parent scope, this can be
 *   done by passing a map of local variable names and values into the expression wrapper fn.
 *   For example, if the expression is `increment(amount)` then we can specify the amount value
 *   by calling the `localFn` as `localFn({amount: 22})`.
 *
 *
 * #### `bindToController`
 * When an isolate scope is used for a component (see above), and `controllerAs` is used, `bindToController: true` will
 * allow a component to have its properties bound to the controller, rather than to scope. When the controller
 * is instantiated, the initial values of the isolate scope bindings are already available.
 *
 * #### `controller`
 * Controller constructor function. The controller is instantiated before the
 * pre-linking phase and it is shared with other directives (see
 * `require` attribute). This allows the directives to communicate with each other and augment
 * each other's behavior. The controller is injectable (and supports bracket notation) with the following locals:
 *
 * * `$scope` - Current scope associated with the element
 * * `$element` - Current element
 * * `$attrs` - Current attributes object for the element
 * * `$transclude` - A transclude linking function pre-bound to the correct transclusion scope:
 *   `function([scope], cloneLinkingFn, futureParentElement)`.
 *    * `scope`: optional argument to override the scope.
 *    * `cloneLinkingFn`: optional argument to create clones of the original transcluded content.
 *    * `futureParentElement`:
 *        * defines the parent to which the `cloneLinkingFn` will add the cloned elements.
 *        * default: `$element.parent()` resp. `$element` for `transclude:'element'` resp. `transclude:true`.
 *        * only needed for transcludes that are allowed to contain non html elements (e.g. SVG elements)
 *          and when the `cloneLinkinFn` is passed,
 *          as those elements need to created and cloned in a special way when they are defined outside their
 *          usual containers (e.g. like `<svg>`).
 *        * See also the `directive.templateNamespace` property.
 *
 *
 * #### `require`
 * Require another directive and inject its controller as the fourth argument to the linking function. The
 * `require` takes a string name (or array of strings) of the directive(s) to pass in. If an array is used, the
 * injected argument will be an array in corresponding order. If no such directive can be
 * found, or if the directive does not have a controller, then an error is raised. The name can be prefixed with:
 *
 * * (no prefix) - Locate the required controller on the current element. Throw an error if not found.
 * * `?` - Attempt to locate the required controller or pass `null` to the `link` fn if not found.
 * * `^` - Locate the required controller by searching the element and its parents. Throw an error if not found.
 * * `^^` - Locate the required controller by searching the element's parents. Throw an error if not found.
 * * `?^` - Attempt to locate the required controller by searching the element and its parents or pass
 *   `null` to the `link` fn if not found.
 * * `?^^` - Attempt to locate the required controller by searching the element's parents, or pass
 *   `null` to the `link` fn if not found.
 *
 *
 * #### `controllerAs`
 * Controller alias at the directive scope. An alias for the controller so it
 * can be referenced at the directive template. The directive needs to define a scope for this
 * configuration to be used. Useful in the case when directive is used as component.
 *
 *
 * #### `restrict`
 * String of subset of `EACM` which restricts the directive to a specific directive
 * declaration style. If omitted, the defaults (elements and attributes) are used.
 *
 * * `E` - Element name (default): `<my-directive></my-directive>`
 * * `A` - Attribute (default): `<div my-directive="exp"></div>`
 * * `C` - Class: `<div class="my-directive: exp;"></div>`
 * * `M` - Comment: `<!-- directive: my-directive exp -->`
 *
 *
 * #### `templateNamespace`
 * String representing the document type used by the markup in the template.
 * AngularJS needs this information as those elements need to be created and cloned
 * in a special way when they are defined outside their usual containers like `<svg>` and `<math>`.
 *
 * * `html` - All root nodes in the template are HTML. Root nodes may also be
 *   top-level elements such as `<svg>` or `<math>`.
 * * `svg` - The root nodes in the template are SVG elements (excluding `<math>`).
 * * `math` - The root nodes in the template are MathML elements (excluding `<svg>`).
 *
 * If no `templateNamespace` is specified, then the namespace is considered to be `html`.
 *
 * #### `template`
 * HTML markup that may:
 * * Replace the contents of the directive's element (default).
 * * Replace the directive's element itself (if `replace` is true - DEPRECATED).
 * * Wrap the contents of the directive's element (if `transclude` is true).
 *
 * Value may be:
 *
 * * A string. For example `<div red-on-hover>{{delete_str}}</div>`.
 * * A function which takes two arguments `tElement` and `tAttrs` (described in the `compile`
 *   function api below) and returns a string value.
 *
 *
 * #### `templateUrl`
 * This is similar to `template` but the template is loaded from the specified URL, asynchronously.
 *
 * Because template loading is asynchronous the compiler will suspend compilation of directives on that element
 * for later when the template has been resolved.  In the meantime it will continue to compile and link
 * sibling and parent elements as though this element had not contained any directives.
 *
 * The compiler does not suspend the entire compilation to wait for templates to be loaded because this
 * would result in the whole app "stalling" until all templates are loaded asynchronously - even in the
 * case when only one deeply nested directive has `templateUrl`.
 *
 * Template loading is asynchronous even if the template has been preloaded into the {@link $templateCache}
 *
 * You can specify `templateUrl` as a string representing the URL or as a function which takes two
 * arguments `tElement` and `tAttrs` (described in the `compile` function api below) and returns
 * a string value representing the url.  In either case, the template URL is passed through {@link
 * $sce#getTrustedResourceUrl $sce.getTrustedResourceUrl}.
 *
 *
 * #### `replace` ([*DEPRECATED*!], will be removed in next major release - i.e. v2.0)
 * specify what the template should replace. Defaults to `false`.
 *
 * * `true` - the template will replace the directive's element.
 * * `false` - the template will replace the contents of the directive's element.
 *
 * The replacement process migrates all of the attributes / classes from the old element to the new
 * one. See the {@link guide/directive#template-expanding-directive
 * Directives Guide} for an example.
 *
 * There are very few scenarios where element replacement is required for the application function,
 * the main one being reusable custom components that are used within SVG contexts
 * (because SVG doesn't work with custom elements in the DOM tree).
 *
 * #### `transclude`
 * Extract the contents of the element where the directive appears and make it available to the directive.
 * The contents are compiled and provided to the directive as a **transclusion function**. See the
 * {@link $compile#transclusion Transclusion} section below.
 *
 * There are two kinds of transclusion depending upon whether you want to transclude just the contents of the
 * directive's element or the entire element:
 *
 * * `true` - transclude the content (i.e. the child nodes) of the directive's element.
 * * `'element'` - transclude the whole of the directive's element including any directives on this
 *   element that defined at a lower priority than this directive. When used, the `template`
 *   property is ignored.
 *
 *
 * #### `compile`
 *
 * ```js
 *   function compile(tElement, tAttrs, transclude) { ... }
 * ```
 *
 * The compile function deals with transforming the template DOM. Since most directives do not do
 * template transformation, it is not used often. The compile function takes the following arguments:
 *
 *   * `tElement` - template element - The element where the directive has been declared. It is
 *     safe to do template transformation on the element and child elements only.
 *
 *   * `tAttrs` - template attributes - Normalized list of attributes declared on this element shared
 *     between all directive compile functions.
 *
 *   * `transclude` -  [*DEPRECATED*!] A transclude linking function: `function(scope, cloneLinkingFn)`
 *
 * <div class="alert alert-warning">
 * **Note:** The template instance and the link instance may be different objects if the template has
 * been cloned. For this reason it is **not** safe to do anything other than DOM transformations that
 * apply to all cloned DOM nodes within the compile function. Specifically, DOM listener registration
 * should be done in a linking function rather than in a compile function.
 * </div>

 * <div class="alert alert-warning">
 * **Note:** The compile function cannot handle directives that recursively use themselves in their
 * own templates or compile functions. Compiling these directives results in an infinite loop and a
 * stack overflow errors.
 *
 * This can be avoided by manually using $compile in the postLink function to imperatively compile
 * a directive's template instead of relying on automatic template compilation via `template` or
 * `templateUrl` declaration or manual compilation inside the compile function.
 * </div>
 *
 * <div class="alert alert-error">
 * **Note:** The `transclude` function that is passed to the compile function is deprecated, as it
 *   e.g. does not know about the right outer scope. Please use the transclude function that is passed
 *   to the link function instead.
 * </div>

 * A compile function can have a return value which can be either a function or an object.
 *
 * * returning a (post-link) function - is equivalent to registering the linking function via the
 *   `link` property of the config object when the compile function is empty.
 *
 * * returning an object with function(s) registered via `pre` and `post` properties - allows you to
 *   control when a linking function should be called during the linking phase. See info about
 *   pre-linking and post-linking functions below.
 *
 *
 * #### `link`
 * This property is used only if the `compile` property is not defined.
 *
 * ```js
 *   function link(scope, iElement, iAttrs, controller, transcludeFn) { ... }
 * ```
 *
 * The link function is responsible for registering DOM listeners as well as updating the DOM. It is
 * executed after the template has been cloned. This is where most of the directive logic will be
 * put.
 *
 *   * `scope` - {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope Scope} - The scope to be used by the
 *     directive for registering {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$watch watches}.
 *
 *   * `iElement` - instance element - The element where the directive is to be used. It is safe to
 *     manipulate the children of the element only in `postLink` function since the children have
 *     already been linked.
 *
 *   * `iAttrs` - instance attributes - Normalized list of attributes declared on this element shared
 *     between all directive linking functions.
 *
 *   * `controller` - a controller instance - A controller instance if at least one directive on the
 *     element defines a controller. The controller is shared among all the directives, which allows
 *     the directives to use the controllers as a communication channel.
 *
 *   * `transcludeFn` - A transclude linking function pre-bound to the correct transclusion scope.
 *     This is the same as the `$transclude`
 *     parameter of directive controllers, see there for details.
 *     `function([scope], cloneLinkingFn, futureParentElement)`.
 *
 * #### Pre-linking function
 *
 * Executed before the child elements are linked. Not safe to do DOM transformation since the
 * compiler linking function will fail to locate the correct elements for linking.
 *
 * #### Post-linking function
 *
 * Executed after the child elements are linked.
 *
 * Note that child elements that contain `templateUrl` directives will not have been compiled
 * and linked since they are waiting for their template to load asynchronously and their own
 * compilation and linking has been suspended until that occurs.
 *
 * It is safe to do DOM transformation in the post-linking function on elements that are not waiting
 * for their async templates to be resolved.
 *
 *
 * ### Transclusion
 *
 * Transclusion is the process of extracting a collection of DOM element from one part of the DOM and
 * copying them to another part of the DOM, while maintaining their connection to the original AngularJS
 * scope from where they were taken.
 *
 * Transclusion is used (often with {@link ngTransclude}) to insert the
 * original contents of a directive's element into a specified place in the template of the directive.
 * The benefit of transclusion, over simply moving the DOM elements manually, is that the transcluded
 * content has access to the properties on the scope from which it was taken, even if the directive
 * has isolated scope.
 * See the {@link guide/directive#creating-a-directive-that-wraps-other-elements Directives Guide}.
 *
 * This makes it possible for the widget to have private state for its template, while the transcluded
 * content has access to its originating scope.
 *
 * <div class="alert alert-warning">
 * **Note:** When testing an element transclude directive you must not place the directive at the root of the
 * DOM fragment that is being compiled. See {@link guide/unit-testing#testing-transclusion-directives
 * Testing Transclusion Directives}.
 * </div>
 *
 * #### Transclusion Functions
 *
 * When a directive requests transclusion, the compiler extracts its contents and provides a **transclusion
 * function** to the directive's `link` function and `controller`. This transclusion function is a special
 * **linking function** that will return the compiled contents linked to a new transclusion scope.
 *
 * <div class="alert alert-info">
 * If you are just using {@link ngTransclude} then you don't need to worry about this function, since
 * ngTransclude will deal with it for us.
 * </div>
 *
 * If you want to manually control the insertion and removal of the transcluded content in your directive
 * then you must use this transclude function. When you call a transclude function it returns a a jqLite/JQuery
 * object that contains the compiled DOM, which is linked to the correct transclusion scope.
 *
 * When you call a transclusion function you can pass in a **clone attach function**. This function accepts
 * two parameters, `function(clone, scope) { ... }`, where the `clone` is a fresh compiled copy of your transcluded
 * content and the `scope` is the newly created transclusion scope, to which the clone is bound.
 *
 * <div class="alert alert-info">
 * **Best Practice**: Always provide a `cloneFn` (clone attach function) when you call a translude function
 * since you then get a fresh clone of the original DOM and also have access to the new transclusion scope.
 * </div>
 *
 * It is normal practice to attach your transcluded content (`clone`) to the DOM inside your **clone
 * attach function**:
 *
 * ```js
 * var transcludedContent, transclusionScope;
 *
 * $transclude(function(clone, scope) {
 *   element.append(clone);
 *   transcludedContent = clone;
 *   transclusionScope = scope;
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * Later, if you want to remove the transcluded content from your DOM then you should also destroy the
 * associated transclusion scope:
 *
 * ```js
 * transcludedContent.remove();
 * transclusionScope.$destroy();
 * ```
 *
 * <div class="alert alert-info">
 * **Best Practice**: if you intend to add and remove transcluded content manually in your directive
 * (by calling the transclude function to get the DOM and and calling `element.remove()` to remove it),
 * then you are also responsible for calling `$destroy` on the transclusion scope.
 * </div>
 *
 * The built-in DOM manipulation directives, such as {@link ngIf}, {@link ngSwitch} and {@link ngRepeat}
 * automatically destroy their transluded clones as necessary so you do not need to worry about this if
 * you are simply using {@link ngTransclude} to inject the transclusion into your directive.
 *
 *
 * #### Transclusion Scopes
 *
 * When you call a transclude function it returns a DOM fragment that is pre-bound to a **transclusion
 * scope**. This scope is special, in that it is a child of the directive's scope (and so gets destroyed
 * when the directive's scope gets destroyed) but it inherits the properties of the scope from which it
 * was taken.
 *
 * For example consider a directive that uses transclusion and isolated scope. The DOM hierarchy might look
 * like this:
 *
 * ```html
 * <div ng-app>
 *   <div isolate>
 *     <div transclusion>
 *     </div>
 *   </div>
 * </div>
 * ```
 *
 * The `$parent` scope hierarchy will look like this:
 *
 * ```
 * - $rootScope
 *   - isolate
 *     - transclusion
 * ```
 *
 * but the scopes will inherit prototypically from different scopes to their `$parent`.
 *
 * ```
 * - $rootScope
 *   - transclusion
 * - isolate
 * ```
 *
 *
 * ### Attributes
 *
 * The {@link ng.$compile.directive.Attributes Attributes} object - passed as a parameter in the
 * `link()` or `compile()` functions. It has a variety of uses.
 *
 * accessing *Normalized attribute names:*
 * Directives like 'ngBind' can be expressed in many ways: 'ng:bind', `data-ng-bind`, or 'x-ng-bind'.
 * the attributes object allows for normalized access to
 *   the attributes.
 *
 * * *Directive inter-communication:* All directives share the same instance of the attributes
 *   object which allows the directives to use the attributes object as inter directive
 *   communication.
 *
 * * *Supports interpolation:* Interpolation attributes are assigned to the attribute object
 *   allowing other directives to read the interpolated value.
 *
 * * *Observing interpolated attributes:* Use `$observe` to observe the value changes of attributes
 *   that contain interpolation (e.g. `src="{{bar}}"`). Not only is this very efficient but it's also
 *   the only way to easily get the actual value because during the linking phase the interpolation
 *   hasn't been evaluated yet and so the value is at this time set to `undefined`.
 *
 * ```js
 * function linkingFn(scope, elm, attrs, ctrl) {
 *   // get the attribute value
 *   console.log(attrs.ngModel);
 *
 *   // change the attribute
 *   attrs.$set('ngModel', 'new value');
 *
 *   // observe changes to interpolated attribute
 *   attrs.$observe('ngModel', function(value) {
 *     console.log('ngModel has changed value to ' + value);
 *   });
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ## Example
 *
 * <div class="alert alert-warning">
 * **Note**: Typically directives are registered with `module.directive`. The example below is
 * to illustrate how `$compile` works.
 * </div>
 *
 <example module="compileExample">
   <file name="index.html">
    <script>
      angular.module('compileExample', [], function($compileProvider) {
        // configure new 'compile' directive by passing a directive
        // factory function. The factory function injects the '$compile'
        $compileProvider.directive('compile', function($compile) {
          // directive factory creates a link function
          return function(scope, element, attrs) {
            scope.$watch(
              function(scope) {
                 // watch the 'compile' expression for changes
                return scope.$eval(attrs.compile);
              },
              function(value) {
                // when the 'compile' expression changes
                // assign it into the current DOM
                element.html(value);

                // compile the new DOM and link it to the current
                // scope.
                // NOTE: we only compile .childNodes so that
                // we don't get into infinite loop compiling ourselves

              }
            );
          };
        });
      })
      .controller('GreeterController', ['$scope', function($scope) {
        $scope.name = 'Angular';
        $scope.html = 'Hello {{name}}';
      }]);
    </script>
    <div ng-controller="GreeterController">
      <input ng-model="name"> <br>

 *
 * @param {string|DOMElement} element Element or HTML string to compile into a template function.
 * @param {function(angular.Scope, cloneAttachFn=)} transclude function available to directives - DEPRECATED.
 *
 * <div class="alert alert-error">
 * **Note:** Passing a `transclude` function to the $compile function is deprecated, as it
 *   e.g. will not use the right outer scope. Please pass the transclude function as a
 *   `parentBoundTranscludeFn` to the link function instead.
 * </div>
 *
 * @param {number} maxPriority only apply directives lower than given priority (Only effects the
 *                 root element(s), not their children)
 * @returns {function(scope, cloneAttachFn=, options=)} a link function which is used to bind template
 * (a DOM element/tree) to a scope. Where:
 *
 *  * `scope` - A {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope Scope} to bind to.
 *  * `cloneAttachFn` - If `cloneAttachFn` is provided, then the link function will clone the
 *  `template` and call the `cloneAttachFn` function allowing the caller to attach the
 *  cloned elements to the DOM document at the appropriate place. The `cloneAttachFn` is
 *  called as: <br> `cloneAttachFn(clonedElement, scope)` where:
 *
 *      * `clonedElement` - is a clone of the original `element` passed into the compiler.
 *      * `scope` - is the current scope with which the linking function is working with.
 *
 *  * `options` - An optional object hash with linking options. If `options` is provided, then the following
 *  keys may be used to control linking behavior:
 *
 *      * `parentBoundTranscludeFn` - the transclude function made available to
 *        directives; if given, it will be passed through to the link functions of
 *        directives found in `element` during compilation.
 *      * `transcludeControllers` - an object hash with keys that map controller names
 *        to controller instances; if given, it will make the controllers
 *        available to directives.
 *      * `futureParentElement` - defines the parent to which the `cloneAttachFn` will add
 *        the cloned elements; only needed for transcludes that are allowed to contain non html
 *        elements (e.g. SVG elements). See also the directive.controller property.
 *
 * Calling the linking function returns the element of the template. It is either the original
 * element passed in, or the clone of the element if the `cloneAttachFn` is provided.
 *
 * After linking the view is not updated until after a call to $digest which typically is done by
 * Angular automatically.
 *
 * If you need access to the bound view, there are two ways to do it:
 *
 * - If you are not asking the linking function to clone the template, create the DOM element(s)
 *   before you send them to the compiler and keep this reference around.
 *   ```js
 *     var element = $compile('<p>{{total}}</p>')(scope);
 *   ```
 *
 * - if on the other hand, you need the element to be cloned, the view reference from the original
 *   example would not point to the clone, but rather to the original template that was cloned. In
 *   this case, you can access the clone via the cloneAttachFn:
 *   ```js
 *     var templateElement = angular.element('<p>{{total}}</p>'),
 *         scope = ....;
 *
 *     var clonedElement = $compile(templateElement)(scope, function(clonedElement, scope) {
 *       //attach the clone to DOM document at the right place
 *     });
 *
 *     //now we have reference to the cloned DOM via `clonedElement`
 *   ```
 *
 *
 * For information on how the compiler works, see the
 * {@link guide/compiler Angular HTML Compiler} section of the Developer Guide.

 *
 * @description
 * Any uncaught exception in angular expressions is delegated to this service.

 * the browser console.
 *
 * In unit tests, if `angular-mocks.js` is loaded, this service is overridden by
 * {@link ngMock.$exceptionHandler mock $exceptionHandler} which aids in testing.
 *
 * ## Example:
 *
 * ```js
 *   angular.module('exceptionOverride', []).factory('$exceptionHandler', function() {

 *       exception.message += ' (caused by "' + cause + '")';

 * ```
 *
 * This example will override the normal action of `$exceptionHandler`, to make angular
 * exceptions fail hard when they happen, instead of just logging to the console.
 *
 * <hr />
 * Note, that code executed in event-listeners (even those registered using jqLite's `on`/`bind`
 * methods) does not delegate exceptions to the {@link ng.$exceptionHandler $exceptionHandler}
 * (unless executed during a digest).
 *
 * If you wish, you can manually delegate exceptions, e.g.
 * `try { ... } catch(e) { $exceptionHandler(e); }`

     *
     * @description
     * The `$http` service is a core Angular service that facilitates communication with the remote
     * HTTP servers via the browser's [XMLHttpRequest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/xmlhttprequest)
     * object or via [JSONP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP).
     *
     * For unit testing applications that use `$http` service, see
     * {@link ngMock.$httpBackend $httpBackend mock}.
     *
     * For a higher level of abstraction, please check out the {@link ngResource.$resource
     * $resource} service.
     *
     * The $http API is based on the {@link ng.$q deferred/promise APIs} exposed by
     * the $q service. While for simple usage patterns this doesn't matter much, for advanced usage
     * it is important to familiarize yourself with these APIs and the guarantees they provide.
     *
     *
     * ## General usage
     * The `$http` service is a function which takes a single argument — a configuration object —
     * that is used to generate an HTTP request and returns  a {@link ng.$q promise}
     * with two $http specific methods: `success` and `error`.
     *
     * ```js
     *   // Simple GET request example :
     *   $http.get('/someUrl').
     *     success(function(data, status, headers, config) {
     *       // this callback will be called asynchronously
     *       // when the response is available
     *     }).
     *     error(function(data, status, headers, config) {
     *       // called asynchronously if an error occurs
     *       // or server returns response with an error status.
     *     });
     * ```
     *
     * ```js
     *   // Simple POST request example (passing data) :
     *   $http.post('/someUrl', {msg:'hello word!'}).
     *     success(function(data, status, headers, config) {
     *       // this callback will be called asynchronously
     *       // when the response is available
     *     }).
     *     error(function(data, status, headers, config) {
     *       // called asynchronously if an error occurs
     *       // or server returns response with an error status.
     *     });
     * ```
     *
     *
     * Since the returned value of calling the $http function is a `promise`, you can also use
     * the `then` method to register callbacks, and these callbacks will receive a single argument –
     * an object representing the response. See the API signature and type info below for more
     * details.
     *
     * A response status code between 200 and 299 is considered a success status and
     * will result in the success callback being called. Note that if the response is a redirect,
     * XMLHttpRequest will transparently follow it, meaning that the error callback will not be
     * called for such responses.
     *
     * ## Writing Unit Tests that use $http
     * When unit testing (using {@link ngMock ngMock}), it is necessary to call
     * {@link ngMock.$httpBackend#flush $httpBackend.flush()} to flush each pending
     * request using trained responses.
     *
     * ```
     * $httpBackend.expectGET(...);
     * $http.get(...);
     * $httpBackend.flush();
     * ```
     *
     * ## Shortcut methods
     *
     * Shortcut methods are also available. All shortcut methods require passing in the URL, and
     * request data must be passed in for POST/PUT requests.
     *
     * ```js
     *   $http.get('/someUrl').success(successCallback);
     *   $http.post('/someUrl', data).success(successCallback);
     * ```
     *
     * Complete list of shortcut methods:
     *
     * - {@link ng.$http#get $http.get}
     * - {@link ng.$http#head $http.head}
     * - {@link ng.$http#post $http.post}
     * - {@link ng.$http#put $http.put}
     * - {@link ng.$http#delete $http.delete}
     * - {@link ng.$http#jsonp $http.jsonp}
     * - {@link ng.$http#patch $http.patch}
     *
     *
     * ## Setting HTTP Headers
     *
     * The $http service will automatically add certain HTTP headers to all requests. These defaults
     * can be fully configured by accessing the `$httpProvider.defaults.headers` configuration
     * object, which currently contains this default configuration:
     *
     * - `$httpProvider.defaults.headers.common` (headers that are common for all requests):
     *   - `Accept: application/json, text/plain, * / *`
     * - `$httpProvider.defaults.headers.post`: (header defaults for POST requests)
     *   - `Content-Type: application/json`
     * - `$httpProvider.defaults.headers.put` (header defaults for PUT requests)
     *   - `Content-Type: application/json`
     *
     * To add or overwrite these defaults, simply add or remove a property from these configuration
     * objects. To add headers for an HTTP method other than POST or PUT, simply add a new object
     * with the lowercased HTTP method name as the key, e.g.
     * `$httpProvider.defaults.headers.get = { 'My-Header' : 'value' }.
     *
     * The defaults can also be set at runtime via the `$http.defaults` object in the same
     * fashion. For example:
     *
     * ```
     * module.run(function($http) {
     *   $http.defaults.headers.common.Authorization = 'Basic YmVlcDpib29w'
     * });
     * ```
     *
     * In addition, you can supply a `headers` property in the config object passed when
     * calling `$http(config)`, which overrides the defaults without changing them globally.
     *
     * To explicitly remove a header automatically added via $httpProvider.defaults.headers on a per request basis,
     * Use the `headers` property, setting the desired header to `undefined`. For example:
     *
     * ```js
     * var req = {
     *  method: 'POST',
     *  url: 'http://example.com',
     *  headers: {
     *    'Content-Type': undefined
     *  },
     *  data: { test: 'test' },
     * }
     *
     * $http(req).success(function(){...}).error(function(){...});
     * ```
     *
     * ## Transforming Requests and Responses
     *
     * Both requests and responses can be transformed using transformation functions: `transformRequest`
     * and `transformResponse`. These properties can be a single function that returns
     * the transformed value (`{function(data, headersGetter, status)`) or an array of such transformation functions,
     * which allows you to `push` or `unshift` a new transformation function into the transformation chain.
     *
     * ### Default Transformations
     *
     * The `$httpProvider` provider and `$http` service expose `defaults.transformRequest` and
     * `defaults.transformResponse` properties. If a request does not provide its own transformations
     * then these will be applied.
     *
     * You can augment or replace the default transformations by modifying these properties by adding to or
     * replacing the array.
     *
     * Angular provides the following default transformations:
     *
     * Request transformations (`$httpProvider.defaults.transformRequest` and `$http.defaults.transformRequest`):
     *
     * - If the `data` property of the request configuration object contains an object, serialize it
     *   into JSON format.
     *
     * Response transformations (`$httpProvider.defaults.transformResponse` and `$http.defaults.transformResponse`):
     *
     *  - If XSRF prefix is detected, strip it (see Security Considerations section below).
     *  - If JSON response is detected, deserialize it using a JSON parser.
     *
     *
     * ### Overriding the Default Transformations Per Request
     *
     * If you wish override the request/response transformations only for a single request then provide
     * `transformRequest` and/or `transformResponse` properties on the configuration object passed
     * into `$http`.
     *
     * Note that if you provide these properties on the config object the default transformations will be
     * overwritten. If you wish to augment the default transformations then you must include them in your
     * local transformation array.
     *
     * The following code demonstrates adding a new response transformation to be run after the default response
     * transformations have been run.
     *
     * ```js
     * function appendTransform(defaults, transform) {
     *
     *   // We can't guarantee that the default transformation is an array
     *   defaults = angular.isArray(defaults) ? defaults : [defaults];
     *
     *   // Append the new transformation to the defaults
     *   return defaults.concat(transform);
     * }
     *
     * $http({
     *   url: '...',
     *   method: 'GET',
     *   transformResponse: appendTransform($http.defaults.transformResponse, function(value) {
     *     return doTransform(value);
     *   })
     * });
     * ```
     *
     *
     * ## Caching
     *
     * To enable caching, set the request configuration `cache` property to `true` (to use default
     * cache) or to a custom cache object (built with {@link ng.$cacheFactory `$cacheFactory`}).
     * When the cache is enabled, `$http` stores the response from the server in the specified
     * cache. The next time the same request is made, the response is served from the cache without
     * sending a request to the server.
     *
     * Note that even if the response is served from cache, delivery of the data is asynchronous in
     * the same way that real requests are.
     *
     * If there are multiple GET requests for the same URL that should be cached using the same
     * cache, but the cache is not populated yet, only one request to the server will be made and
     * the remaining requests will be fulfilled using the response from the first request.
     *
     * You can change the default cache to a new object (built with
     * {@link ng.$cacheFactory `$cacheFactory`}) by updating the
     * {@link ng.$http#defaults `$http.defaults.cache`} property. All requests who set
     * their `cache` property to `true` will now use this cache object.
     *
     * If you set the default cache to `false` then only requests that specify their own custom
     * cache object will be cached.
     *
     * ## Interceptors
     *
     * Before you start creating interceptors, be sure to understand the
     * {@link ng.$q $q and deferred/promise APIs}.
     *
     * For purposes of global error handling, authentication, or any kind of synchronous or
     * asynchronous pre-processing of request or postprocessing of responses, it is desirable to be
     * able to intercept requests before they are handed to the server and
     * responses before they are handed over to the application code that
     * initiated these requests. The interceptors leverage the {@link ng.$q
     * promise APIs} to fulfill this need for both synchronous and asynchronous pre-processing.
     *
     * The interceptors are service factories that are registered with the `$httpProvider` by
     * adding them to the `$httpProvider.interceptors` array. The factory is called and
     * injected with dependencies (if specified) and returns the interceptor.
     *
     * There are two kinds of interceptors (and two kinds of rejection interceptors):
     *
     *   * `request`: interceptors get called with a http `config` object. The function is free to
     *     modify the `config` object or create a new one. The function needs to return the `config`
     *     object directly, or a promise containing the `config` or a new `config` object.
     *   * `requestError`: interceptor gets called when a previous interceptor threw an error or
     *     resolved with a rejection.
     *   * `response`: interceptors get called with http `response` object. The function is free to
     *     modify the `response` object or create a new one. The function needs to return the `response`
     *     object directly, or as a promise containing the `response` or a new `response` object.
     *   * `responseError`: interceptor gets called when a previous interceptor threw an error or
     *     resolved with a rejection.
     *
     *
     * ```js
     *   // register the interceptor as a service
     *   $provide.factory('myHttpInterceptor', function($q, dependency1, dependency2) {
     *     return {
     *       // optional method
     *       'request': function(config) {
     *         // do something on success
     *         return config;
     *       },
     *
     *       // optional method
     *      'requestError': function(rejection) {
     *         // do something on error
     *         if (canRecover(rejection)) {
     *           return responseOrNewPromise
     *         }
     *         return $q.reject(rejection);
     *       },
     *
     *
     *
     *       // optional method
     *       'response': function(response) {
     *         // do something on success
     *         return response;
     *       },
     *
     *       // optional method
     *      'responseError': function(rejection) {
     *         // do something on error
     *         if (canRecover(rejection)) {
     *           return responseOrNewPromise
     *         }
     *         return $q.reject(rejection);
     *       }
     *     };
     *   });
     *
     *   $httpProvider.interceptors.push('myHttpInterceptor');
     *
     *
     *   // alternatively, register the interceptor via an anonymous factory
     *   $httpProvider.interceptors.push(function($q, dependency1, dependency2) {
     *     return {
     *      'request': function(config) {
     *          // same as above
     *       },
     *
     *       'response': function(response) {
     *          // same as above
     *       }
     *     };
     *   });
     * ```
     *
     * ## Security Considerations
     *
     * When designing web applications, consider security threats from:
     *
     * - [JSON vulnerability](http://haacked.com/archive/2008/11/20/anatomy-of-a-subtle-json-vulnerability.aspx)
     * - [XSRF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery)
     *
     * Both server and the client must cooperate in order to eliminate these threats. Angular comes
     * pre-configured with strategies that address these issues, but for this to work backend server
     * cooperation is required.
     *
     * ### JSON Vulnerability Protection
     *
     * A [JSON vulnerability](http://haacked.com/archive/2008/11/20/anatomy-of-a-subtle-json-vulnerability.aspx)
     * allows third party website to turn your JSON resource URL into
     * [JSONP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP) request under some conditions. To
     * counter this your server can prefix all JSON requests with following string `")]}',\n"`.
     * Angular will automatically strip the prefix before processing it as JSON.
     *
     * For example if your server needs to return:
     * ```js
     * ['one','two']
     * ```
     *
     * which is vulnerable to attack, your server can return:
     * ```js
     * )]}',
     * ['one','two']
     * ```
     *
     * Angular will strip the prefix, before processing the JSON.
     *
     *
     * ### Cross Site Request Forgery (XSRF) Protection
     *
     * [XSRF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery) is a technique by which
     * an unauthorized site can gain your user's private data. Angular provides a mechanism
     * to counter XSRF. When performing XHR requests, the $http service reads a token from a cookie
     * (by default, `XSRF-TOKEN`) and sets it as an HTTP header (`X-XSRF-TOKEN`). Since only
     * JavaScript that runs on your domain could read the cookie, your server can be assured that
     * the XHR came from JavaScript running on your domain. The header will not be set for
     * cross-domain requests.
     *
     * To take advantage of this, your server needs to set a token in a JavaScript readable session
     * cookie called `XSRF-TOKEN` on the first HTTP GET request. On subsequent XHR requests the
     * server can verify that the cookie matches `X-XSRF-TOKEN` HTTP header, and therefore be sure
     * that only JavaScript running on your domain could have sent the request. The token must be
     * unique for each user and must be verifiable by the server (to prevent the JavaScript from
     * making up its own tokens). We recommend that the token is a digest of your site's
     * authentication cookie with a [salt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography&#41;)
     * for added security.
     *
     * The name of the headers can be specified using the xsrfHeaderName and xsrfCookieName
     * properties of either $httpProvider.defaults at config-time, $http.defaults at run-time,
     * or the per-request config object.
     *
     *
     * @param {object} config Object describing the request to be made and how it should be
     *    processed. The object has following properties:
     *
     *    - **method** – `{string}` – HTTP method (e.g. 'GET', 'POST', etc)
     *    - **url** – `{string}` – Absolute or relative URL of the resource that is being requested.
     *    - **params** – `{Object.<string|Object>}` – Map of strings or objects which will be turned
     *      to `?key1=value1&key2=value2` after the url. If the value is not a string, it will be
     *      JSONified.
     *    - **data** – `{string|Object}` – Data to be sent as the request message data.
     *    - **headers** – `{Object}` – Map of strings or functions which return strings representing
     *      HTTP headers to send to the server. If the return value of a function is null, the
     *      header will not be sent.
     *    - **xsrfHeaderName** – `{string}` – Name of HTTP header to populate with the XSRF token.
     *    - **xsrfCookieName** – `{string}` – Name of cookie containing the XSRF token.
     *    - **transformRequest** –
     *      `{function(data, headersGetter)|Array.<function(data, headersGetter)>}` –
     *      transform function or an array of such functions. The transform function takes the http
     *      request body and headers and returns its transformed (typically serialized) version.
     *      See {@link ng.$http#overriding-the-default-transformations-per-request
     *      Overriding the Default Transformations}
     *    - **transformResponse** –
     *      `{function(data, headersGetter, status)|Array.<function(data, headersGetter, status)>}` –
     *      transform function or an array of such functions. The transform function takes the http
     *      response body, headers and status and returns its transformed (typically deserialized) version.
     *      See {@link ng.$http#overriding-the-default-transformations-per-request
     *      Overriding the Default Transformations}
     *    - **cache** – `{boolean|Cache}` – If true, a default $http cache will be used to cache the
     *      GET request, otherwise if a cache instance built with
     *      {@link ng.$cacheFactory $cacheFactory}, this cache will be used for
     *      caching.
     *    - **timeout** – `{number|Promise}` – timeout in milliseconds, or {@link ng.$q promise}
     *      that should abort the request when resolved.
     *    - **withCredentials** - `{boolean}` - whether to set the `withCredentials` flag on the
     *      XHR object. See [requests with credentials](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS#Requests_with_credentials)
     *      for more information.
     *    - **responseType** - `{string}` - see
     *      [requestType](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/XMLHttpRequest#responseType).
     *
     * @returns {HttpPromise} Returns a {@link ng.$q promise} object with the
     *   standard `then` method and two http specific methods: `success` and `error`. The `then`
     *   method takes two arguments a success and an error callback which will be called with a
     *   response object. The `success` and `error` methods take a single argument - a function that
     *   will be called when the request succeeds or fails respectively. The arguments passed into
     *   these functions are destructured representation of the response object passed into the
     *   `then` method. The response object has these properties:
     *
     *   - **data** – `{string|Object}` – The response body transformed with the transform
     *     functions.
     *   - **status** – `{number}` – HTTP status code of the response.
     *   - **headers** – `{function([headerName])}` – Header getter function.
     *   - **config** – `{Object}` – The configuration object that was used to generate the request.
     *   - **statusText** – `{string}` – HTTP status text of the response.
     *
     * @property {Array.<Object>} pendingRequests Array of config objects for currently pending
     *   requests. This is primarily meant to be used for debugging purposes.

     * @description
     *
     * Compiles a string with markup into an interpolation function. This service is used by the
     * HTML {@link ng.$compile $compile} service for data binding. See
     * {@link ng.$interpolateProvider $interpolateProvider} for configuring the
     * interpolation markup.
     *
     *
     * ```js
     *   var $interpolate = ...; // injected
     *   var exp = $interpolate('Hello {{name | uppercase}}!');
     *   expect(exp({name:'Angular'}).toEqual('Hello ANGULAR!');
     * ```
     *
     * `$interpolate` takes an optional fourth argument, `allOrNothing`. If `allOrNothing` is
     * `true`, the interpolation function will return `undefined` unless all embedded expressions
     * evaluate to a value other than `undefined`.
     *
     * ```js
     *   var $interpolate = ...; // injected
     *   var context = {greeting: 'Hello', name: undefined };
     *
     *   // default "forgiving" mode
     *   var exp = $interpolate('{{greeting}} {{name}}!');
     *   expect(exp(context)).toEqual('Hello !');

     *   expect(exp(context)).toBeUndefined();
     *   context.name = 'Angular';
     *   expect(exp(context)).toEqual('Hello Angular!');
     * ```
     *
     * `allOrNothing` is useful for interpolating URLs. `ngSrc` and `ngSrcset` use this behavior.
     *
     * ####Escaped Interpolation
     * $interpolate provides a mechanism for escaping interpolation markers. Start and end markers
     * can be escaped by preceding each of their characters with a REVERSE SOLIDUS U+005C (backslash).
     * It will be rendered as a regular start/end marker, and will not be interpreted as an expression
     * or binding.
     *
     * This enables web-servers to prevent script injection attacks and defacing attacks, to some
     * degree, while also enabling code examples to work without relying on the
     * {@link ng.directive:ngNonBindable ngNonBindable} directive.
     *
     * **For security purposes, it is strongly encouraged that web servers escape user-supplied data,
     * replacing angle brackets (&lt;, &gt;) with &amp;lt; and &amp;gt; respectively, and replacing all
     * interpolation start/end markers with their escaped counterparts.**
     *
     * Escaped interpolation markers are only replaced with the actual interpolation markers in rendered
     * output when the $interpolate service processes the text. So, for HTML elements interpolated
     * by {@link ng.$compile $compile}, or otherwise interpolated with the `mustHaveExpression` parameter
     * set to `true`, the interpolated text must contain an unescaped interpolation expression. As such,
     * this is typically useful only when user-data is used in rendering a template from the server, or
     * when otherwise untrusted data is used by a directive.
     *
     * <example>
     *  <file name="index.html">
     *    <div ng-init="username='A user'">
     *      <p ng-init="apptitle='Escaping demo'">{{apptitle}}: \{\{ username = "defaced value"; \}\}
     *        </p>
     *      <p><strong>{{username}}</strong> attempts to inject code which will deface the
     *        application, but fails to accomplish their task, because the server has correctly
     *        escaped the interpolation start/end markers with REVERSE SOLIDUS U+005C (backslash)
     *        characters.</p>
     *      <p>Instead, the result of the attempted script injection is visible, and can be removed
     *        from the database by an administrator.</p>
     *    </div>
     *  </file>
     * </example>
     *
     * @param {string} text The text with markup to interpolate.
     * @param {boolean=} mustHaveExpression if set to true then the interpolation string must have
     *    embedded expression in order to return an interpolation function. Strings with no
     *    embedded expression will return null for the interpolation function.
     * @param {string=} trustedContext when provided, the returned function passes the interpolated
     *    result through {@link ng.$sce#getTrusted $sce.getTrusted(interpolatedResult,
     *    trustedContext)} before returning it.  Refer to the {@link ng.$sce $sce} service that
     *    provides Strict Contextual Escaping for details.

      *
      * @description
      * Angular's wrapper for `window.setInterval`. The `fn` function is executed every `delay`
      * milliseconds.
      *
      * The return value of registering an interval function is a promise. This promise will be
      * notified upon each tick of the interval, and will be resolved after `count` iterations, or
      * run indefinitely if `count` is not defined. The value of the notification will be the
      * number of iterations that have run.
      * To cancel an interval, call `$interval.cancel(promise)`.
      *
      * In tests you can use {@link ngMock.$interval#flush `$interval.flush(millis)`} to
      * move forward by `millis` milliseconds and trigger any functions scheduled to run in that
      * time.
      *
      * <div class="alert alert-warning">
      * **Note**: Intervals created by this service must be explicitly destroyed when you are finished
      * with them.  In particular they are not automatically destroyed when a controller's scope or a
      * directive's element are destroyed.
      * You should take this into consideration and make sure to always cancel the interval at the
      * appropriate moment.  See the example below for more details on how and when to do this.
      * </div>
      *
      * @param {function()} fn A function that should be called repeatedly.
      * @param {number} delay Number of milliseconds between each function call.
      * @param {number=} [count=0] Number of times to repeat. If not set, or 0, will repeat
      *   indefinitely.
      * @param {boolean=} [invokeApply=true] If set to `false` skips model dirty checking, otherwise
      *   will invoke `fn` within the {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$apply $apply} block.
      * @returns {promise} A promise which will be notified on each iteration.

// Sandboxing Angular Expressions
// ------------------------------
// Angular expressions are generally considered safe because these expressions only have direct
// access to `$scope` and locals. However, one can obtain the ability to execute arbitrary JS code by
// obtaining a reference to native JS functions such as the Function constructor.
//
// As an example, consider the following Angular expression:
//
//   {}.toString.constructor('alert("evil JS code")')
//
// This sandboxing technique is not perfect and doesn't aim to be. The goal is to prevent exploits
// against the expression language, but not to prevent exploits that were enabled by exposing
// sensitive JavaScript or browser APIs on Scope. Exposing such objects on a Scope is never a good
// practice and therefore we are not even trying to protect against interaction with an object
// explicitly exposed in this way.
//
// In general, it is not possible to access a Window object from an angular expression unless a
// window or some DOM object that has a reference to window is published onto a Scope.
// Similarly we prevent invocations of function known to be dangerous, as well as assignments to
// native objects.
//
// See https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/security

/**
 * @ngdoc service
 * @name $q
 * @requires $rootScope
 *
 * @description
 * A service that helps you run functions asynchronously, and use their return values (or exceptions)
 * when they are done processing.
 *
 * This is an implementation of promises/deferred objects inspired by
 * [Kris Kowal's Q](https://github.com/kriskowal/q).
 *
 * $q can be used in two fashions --- one which is more similar to Kris Kowal's Q or jQuery's Deferred
 * implementations, and the other which resembles ES6 promises to some degree.
 *
 * # $q constructor
 *
 * The streamlined ES6 style promise is essentially just using $q as a constructor which takes a `resolver`
 * function as the first argument. This is similar to the native Promise implementation from ES6 Harmony,
 * see [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise).
 *
 * While the constructor-style use is supported, not all of the supporting methods from ES6 Harmony promises are
 * available yet.
 *
 * It can be used like so:
 *
 * ```js
 *   // for the purpose of this example let's assume that variables `$q` and `okToGreet`
 *   // are available in the current lexical scope (they could have been injected or passed in).
 *
 *   function asyncGreet(name) {
 *     // perform some asynchronous operation, resolve or reject the promise when appropriate.
 *     return $q(function(resolve, reject) {
 *       setTimeout(function() {
 *         if (okToGreet(name)) {
 *           resolve('Hello, ' + name + '!');
 *         } else {
 *           reject('Greeting ' + name + ' is not allowed.');
 *         }
 *       }, 1000);
 *     });
 *   }
 *
 *   var promise = asyncGreet('Robin Hood');
 *   promise.then(function(greeting) {
 *     alert('Success: ' + greeting);
 *   }, function(reason) {
 *     alert('Failed: ' + reason);
 *   });
 * ```
 *
 * Note: progress/notify callbacks are not currently supported via the ES6-style interface.
 *
 * However, the more traditional CommonJS-style usage is still available, and documented below.
 *
 * [The CommonJS Promise proposal](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Promises) describes a promise as an
 * interface for interacting with an object that represents the result of an action that is
 * performed asynchronously, and may or may not be finished at any given point in time.
 *
 * From the perspective of dealing with error handling, deferred and promise APIs are to
 * asynchronous programming what `try`, `catch` and `throw` keywords are to synchronous programming.
 *
 * ```js
 *   // for the purpose of this example let's assume that variables `$q` and `okToGreet`
 *   // are available in the current lexical scope (they could have been injected or passed in).
 *
 *   function asyncGreet(name) {
 *     var deferred = $q.defer();
 *
 *     setTimeout(function() {
 *       deferred.notify('About to greet ' + name + '.');
 *
 *       if (okToGreet(name)) {
 *         deferred.resolve('Hello, ' + name + '!');
 *       } else {
 *         deferred.reject('Greeting ' + name + ' is not allowed.');
 *       }
 *     }, 1000);
 *
 *     return deferred.promise;
 *   }
 *
 *   var promise = asyncGreet('Robin Hood');
 *   promise.then(function(greeting) {
 *     alert('Success: ' + greeting);
 *   }, function(reason) {
 *     alert('Failed: ' + reason);
 *   }, function(update) {
 *     alert('Got notification: ' + update);
 *   });
 * ```
 *
 * At first it might not be obvious why this extra complexity is worth the trouble. The payoff
 * comes in the way of guarantees that promise and deferred APIs make, see
 * https://github.com/kriskowal/uncommonjs/blob/master/promises/specification.md.
 *
 * Additionally the promise api allows for composition that is very hard to do with the
 * traditional callback ([CPS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuation-passing_style)) approach.
 * For more on this please see the [Q documentation](https://github.com/kriskowal/q) especially the
 * section on serial or parallel joining of promises.
 *
 * # The Deferred API
 *
 * A new instance of deferred is constructed by calling `$q.defer()`.
 *
 * The purpose of the deferred object is to expose the associated Promise instance as well as APIs
 * that can be used for signaling the successful or unsuccessful completion, as well as the status
 * of the task.
 *
 * **Methods**
 *
 * - `resolve(value)` – resolves the derived promise with the `value`. If the value is a rejection
 *   constructed via `$q.reject`, the promise will be rejected instead.
 * - `reject(reason)` – rejects the derived promise with the `reason`. This is equivalent to
 *   resolving it with a rejection constructed via `$q.reject`.
 * - `notify(value)` - provides updates on the status of the promise's execution. This may be called
 *   multiple times before the promise is either resolved or rejected.
 *
 * **Properties**
 *
 * - promise – `{Promise}` – promise object associated with this deferred.
 *
 *
 * # The Promise API
 *
 * A new promise instance is created when a deferred instance is created and can be retrieved by
 * calling `deferred.promise`.
 *
 * The purpose of the promise object is to allow for interested parties to get access to the result
 * of the deferred task when it completes.
 *
 * **Methods**
 *
 * - `then(successCallback, errorCallback, notifyCallback)` – regardless of when the promise was or
 *   will be resolved or rejected, `then` calls one of the success or error callbacks asynchronously
 *   as soon as the result is available. The callbacks are called with a single argument: the result
 *   or rejection reason. Additionally, the notify callback may be called zero or more times to
 *   provide a progress indication, before the promise is resolved or rejected.
 *
 *   This method *returns a new promise* which is resolved or rejected via the return value of the
 *   `successCallback`, `errorCallback`. It also notifies via the return value of the
 *   `notifyCallback` method. The promise cannot be resolved or rejected from the notifyCallback
 *   method.
 *
 * - `catch(errorCallback)` – shorthand for `promise.then(null, errorCallback)`
 *
 * - `finally(callback, notifyCallback)` – allows you to observe either the fulfillment or rejection of a promise,
 *   but to do so without modifying the final value. This is useful to release resources or do some
 *   clean-up that needs to be done whether the promise was rejected or resolved. See the [full
 *   specification](https://github.com/kriskowal/q/wiki/API-Reference#promisefinallycallback) for
 *   more information.
 *
 * # Chaining promises
 *
 * Because calling the `then` method of a promise returns a new derived promise, it is easily
 * possible to create a chain of promises:
 *
 * ```js
 *   promiseB = promiseA.then(function(result) {
 *     return result + 1;
 *   });
 *
 *   // promiseB will be resolved immediately after promiseA is resolved and its value
 *   // will be the result of promiseA incremented by 1
 * ```
 *
 * It is possible to create chains of any length and since a promise can be resolved with another
 * promise (which will defer its resolution further), it is possible to pause/defer resolution of
 * the promises at any point in the chain. This makes it possible to implement powerful APIs like
 * $http's response interceptors.
 *
 *
 * # Differences between Kris Kowal's Q and $q
 *
 *  There are two main differences:
 *
 * - $q is integrated with the {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope} Scope model observation
 *   mechanism in angular, which means faster propagation of resolution or rejection into your
 *   models and avoiding unnecessary browser repaints, which would result in flickering UI.
 * - Q has many more features than $q, but that comes at a cost of bytes. $q is tiny, but contains
 *   all the important functionality needed for common async tasks.
 *
 *  # Testing
 *
 *  ```js
 *    it('should simulate promise', inject(function($q, $rootScope) {
 *      var deferred = $q.defer();
 *      var promise = deferred.promise;
 *      var resolvedValue;
 *
 *      promise.then(function(value) { resolvedValue = value; });
 *      expect(resolvedValue).toBeUndefined();
 *
 *      // Simulate resolving of promise
 *      deferred.resolve(123);
 *      // Note that the 'then' function does not get called synchronously.
 *      // This is because we want the promise API to always be async, whether or not
 *      // it got called synchronously or asynchronously.
 *      expect(resolvedValue).toBeUndefined();
 *
 *      // Propagate promise resolution to 'then' functions using $apply().
 *      $rootScope.$apply();
 *      expect(resolvedValue).toEqual(123);
 *    }));
 *  ```
 *
 * @param {function(function, function)} resolver Function which is responsible for resolving or
 *   rejecting the newly created promise. The first parameter is a function which resolves the
 *   promise, the second parameter is a function which rejects the promise.
 *
 * @returns {Promise} The newly created promise.

/**
 * DESIGN NOTES
 *
 * The design decisions behind the scope are heavily favored for speed and memory consumption.
 *
 * The typical use of scope is to watch the expressions, which most of the time return the same
 * value as last time so we optimize the operation.
 *
 * Closures construction is expensive in terms of speed as well as memory:
 *   - No closures, instead use prototypical inheritance for API
 *   - Internal state needs to be stored on scope directly, which means that private state is
 *     exposed as $$____ properties
 *
 * Loop operations are optimized by using while(count--) { ... }
 *   - this means that in order to keep the same order of execution as addition we have to add
 *     items to the array at the beginning (unshift) instead of at the end (push)
 *
 * Child scopes are created and removed often
 *   - Using an array would be slow since inserts in middle are expensive so we use linked list
 *
 * There are few watches then a lot of observers. This is why you don't want the observer to be
 * implemented in the same way as watch. Watch requires return of initialization function which
 * are expensive to construct.

     * A scope can inherit from a parent scope, as in this example:

         expect(parent.salutation).toEqual('Hello');
     * ```
     *
     * When interacting with `Scope` in tests, additional helper methods are available on the

       * Registers a `listener` callback to be executed whenever the `watchExpression` changes.
       *
       * - The `watchExpression` is called on every call to {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$digest
       *   $digest()} and should return the value that will be watched. (Since
       *   {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$digest $digest()} reruns when it detects changes the
       *   `watchExpression` can execute multiple times per
       *   {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$digest $digest()} and should be idempotent.)
       * - The `listener` is called only when the value from the current `watchExpression` and the
       *   previous call to `watchExpression` are not equal (with the exception of the initial run,
       *   see below). Inequality is determined according to reference inequality,
       *   [strict comparison](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Comparison_Operators)
       *    via the `!==` Javascript operator, unless `objectEquality == true`
       *   (see next point)
       * - When `objectEquality == true`, inequality of the `watchExpression` is determined
       *   according to the {@link angular.equals} function. To save the value of the object for
       *   later comparison, the {@link angular.copy} function is used. This therefore means that
       *   watching complex objects will have adverse memory and performance implications.
       * - The watch `listener` may change the model, which may trigger other `listener`s to fire.
       *   This is achieved by rerunning the watchers until no changes are detected. The rerun
       *   iteration limit is 10 to prevent an infinite loop deadlock.
       *
       *
       * If you want to be notified whenever {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$digest $digest} is called,
       * you can register a `watchExpression` function with no `listener`. (Since `watchExpression`
       * can execute multiple times per {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$digest $digest} cycle when a
       * change is detected, be prepared for multiple calls to your listener.)
       *
       * After a watcher is registered with the scope, the `listener` fn is called asynchronously
       * (via {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$evalAsync $evalAsync}) to initialize the
       * watcher. In rare cases, this is undesirable because the listener is called when the result
       * of `watchExpression` didn't change. To detect this scenario within the `listener` fn, you
       * can compare the `newVal` and `oldVal`. If these two values are identical (`===`) then the
       * listener was called due to initialization.
       *
       *

       * Shallow watches the properties of an object and fires whenever any of the properties change
       * (for arrays, this implies watching the array items; for object maps, this implies watching
       * the properties). If a change is detected, the `listener` callback is fired.
       *
       * - The `obj` collection is observed via standard $watch operation and is examined on every
       *   call to $digest() to see if any items have been added, removed, or moved.
       * - The `listener` is called whenever anything within the `obj` has changed. Examples include
       *   adding, removing, and moving items belonging to an object or array.
       *
       *
       * # Example
       * ```js
          $scope.names = ['igor', 'matias', 'misko', 'james'];
          $scope.dataCount = 4;

          $scope.$watchCollection('names', function(newNames, oldNames) {
            $scope.dataCount = newNames.length;
          });

          expect($scope.dataCount).toEqual(4);
          $scope.$digest();

          //still at 4 ... no changes
          expect($scope.dataCount).toEqual(4);

          $scope.names.pop();
          $scope.$digest();

          //now there's been a change
          expect($scope.dataCount).toEqual(3);
       * ```
       *
       *
       * @param {string|function(scope)} obj Evaluated as {@link guide/expression expression}. The
       *    expression value should evaluate to an object or an array which is observed on each
       *    {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$digest $digest} cycle. Any shallow change within the
       *    collection will trigger a call to the `listener`.
       *
       * @param {function(newCollection, oldCollection, scope)} listener a callback function called
       *    when a change is detected.
       *    - The `newCollection` object is the newly modified data obtained from the `obj` expression
       *    - The `oldCollection` object is a copy of the former collection data.
       *      Due to performance considerations, the`oldCollection` value is computed only if the
       *      `listener` function declares two or more arguments.
       *    - The `scope` argument refers to the current scope.
       *
       * @returns {function()} Returns a de-registration function for this listener. When the
       *    de-registration function is executed, the internal watch operation is terminated.

       * @kind function
       *
       * @description
       * Processes all of the {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$watch watchers} of the current scope and
       * its children. Because a {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$watch watcher}'s listener can change
       * the model, the `$digest()` keeps calling the {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$watch watchers}
       * until no more listeners are firing. This means that it is possible to get into an infinite
       * loop. This function will throw `'Maximum iteration limit exceeded.'` if the number of
       * iterations exceeds 10.
       *
       * Usually, you don't call `$digest()` directly in
       * {@link ng.directive:ngController controllers} or in
       * {@link ng.$compileProvider#directive directives}.
       * Instead, you should call {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$apply $apply()} (typically from within
       * a {@link ng.$compileProvider#directive directive}), which will force a `$digest()`.
       *
       * If you want to be notified whenever `$digest()` is called,
       * you can register a `watchExpression` function with
       * {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$watch $watch()} with no `listener`.
       *
       * In unit tests, you may need to call `$digest()` to simulate the scope life cycle.
       *
       * # Example
       * ```js
           var scope = ...;
           scope.name = 'misko';
           scope.counter = 0;

           expect(scope.counter).toEqual(0);

 *
 * `$sceDelegate` is a service that is used by the `$sce` service to provide {@link ng.$sce Strict
 * Contextual Escaping (SCE)} services to AngularJS.
 *
 * Typically, you would configure or override the {@link ng.$sceDelegate $sceDelegate} instead of
 * the `$sce` service to customize the way Strict Contextual Escaping works in AngularJS.  This is
 * because, while the `$sce` provides numerous shorthand methods, etc., you really only need to
 * override 3 core functions (`trustAs`, `getTrusted` and `valueOf`) to replace the way things
 * work because `$sce` delegates to `$sceDelegate` for these operations.
 *
 * Refer {@link ng.$sceDelegateProvider $sceDelegateProvider} to configure this service.
 *
 * The default instance of `$sceDelegate` should work out of the box with little pain.  While you
 * can override it completely to change the behavior of `$sce`, the common case would
 * involve configuring the {@link ng.$sceDelegateProvider $sceDelegateProvider} instead by setting
 * your own whitelists and blacklists for trusting URLs used for loading AngularJS resources such as
 * templates.  Refer {@link ng.$sceDelegateProvider#resourceUrlWhitelist
 * $sceDelegateProvider.resourceUrlWhitelist} and {@link

 * For the general details about this service in Angular, read the main page for {@link ng.$sce

 *
 * **Example**:  Consider the following case. <a name="example"></a>
 *
 * - your app is hosted at url `http://myapp.example.com/`
 * - but some of your templates are hosted on other domains you control such as
 *   `http://srv01.assets.example.com/`,  `http://srv02.assets.example.com/`, etc.
 * - and you have an open redirect at `http://myapp.example.com/clickThru?...`.
 *

 *
 * ```
 *  angular.module('myApp', []).config(function($sceDelegateProvider) {

 *
 * @description
 *
 * `$sce` is a service that provides Strict Contextual Escaping services to AngularJS.
 *
 * # Strict Contextual Escaping
 *
 * Strict Contextual Escaping (SCE) is a mode in which AngularJS requires bindings in certain
 * contexts to result in a value that is marked as safe to use for that context.  One example of
 * such a context is binding arbitrary html controlled by the user via `ng-bind-html`.  We refer
 * to these contexts as privileged or SCE contexts.
 *
 * As of version 1.2, Angular ships with SCE enabled by default.
 *
 * Note:  When enabled (the default), IE<11 in quirks mode is not supported.  In this mode, IE<11 allow
 * one to execute arbitrary javascript by the use of the expression() syntax.  Refer
 * <http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2008/10/16/ending-expressions.aspx> to learn more about them.
 * You can ensure your document is in standards mode and not quirks mode by adding `<!doctype html>`
 * to the top of your HTML document.
 *
 * SCE assists in writing code in way that (a) is secure by default and (b) makes auditing for
 * security vulnerabilities such as XSS, clickjacking, etc. a lot easier.
 *
 * Here's an example of a binding in a privileged context:
 *
 * ```
 * <input ng-model="userHtml">
 * <div ng-bind-html="userHtml"></div>
 * ```
 *
 * Notice that `ng-bind-html` is bound to `userHtml` controlled by the user.  With SCE
 * disabled, this application allows the user to render arbitrary HTML into the DIV.
 * In a more realistic example, one may be rendering user comments, blog articles, etc. via
 * bindings.  (HTML is just one example of a context where rendering user controlled input creates
 * security vulnerabilities.)
 *
 * For the case of HTML, you might use a library, either on the client side, or on the server side,
 * to sanitize unsafe HTML before binding to the value and rendering it in the document.
 *
 * How would you ensure that every place that used these types of bindings was bound to a value that
 * was sanitized by your library (or returned as safe for rendering by your server?)  How can you
 * ensure that you didn't accidentally delete the line that sanitized the value, or renamed some
 * properties/fields and forgot to update the binding to the sanitized value?
 *
 * To be secure by default, you want to ensure that any such bindings are disallowed unless you can
 * determine that something explicitly says it's safe to use a value for binding in that
 * context.  You can then audit your code (a simple grep would do) to ensure that this is only done
 * for those values that you can easily tell are safe - because they were received from your server,
 * sanitized by your library, etc.  You can organize your codebase to help with this - perhaps
 * allowing only the files in a specific directory to do this.  Ensuring that the internal API
 * exposed by that code doesn't markup arbitrary values as safe then becomes a more manageable task.
 *
 * In the case of AngularJS' SCE service, one uses {@link ng.$sce#trustAs $sce.trustAs}
 * (and shorthand methods such as {@link ng.$sce#trustAsHtml $sce.trustAsHtml}, etc.) to
 * obtain values that will be accepted by SCE / privileged contexts.
 *
 *
 * ## How does it work?
 *
 * In privileged contexts, directives and code will bind to the result of {@link ng.$sce#getTrusted
 * $sce.getTrusted(context, value)} rather than to the value directly.  Directives use {@link
 * ng.$sce#parseAs $sce.parseAs} rather than `$parse` to watch attribute bindings, which performs the
 * {@link ng.$sce#getTrusted $sce.getTrusted} behind the scenes on non-constant literals.
 *
 * As an example, {@link ng.directive:ngBindHtml ngBindHtml} uses {@link
 * ng.$sce#parseAsHtml $sce.parseAsHtml(binding expression)}.  Here's the actual code (slightly
 * simplified):
 *
 * ```
 * var ngBindHtmlDirective = ['$sce', function($sce) {
 *   return function(scope, element, attr) {
 *     scope.$watch($sce.parseAsHtml(attr.ngBindHtml), function(value) {
 *       element.html(value || '');
 *     });
 *   };
 * }];
 * ```
 *
 * ## Impact on loading templates
 *
 * This applies both to the {@link ng.directive:ngInclude `ng-include`} directive as well as
 * `templateUrl`'s specified by {@link guide/directive directives}.
 *
 * By default, Angular only loads templates from the same domain and protocol as the application
 * document.  This is done by calling {@link ng.$sce#getTrustedResourceUrl
 * $sce.getTrustedResourceUrl} on the template URL.  To load templates from other domains and/or
 * protocols, you may either either {@link ng.$sceDelegateProvider#resourceUrlWhitelist whitelist
 * them} or {@link ng.$sce#trustAsResourceUrl wrap it} into a trusted value.
 *
 * *Please note*:
 * The browser's
 * [Same Origin Policy](https://code.google.com/p/browsersec/wiki/Part2#Same-origin_policy_for_XMLHttpRequest)
 * and [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)](http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/)
 * policy apply in addition to this and may further restrict whether the template is successfully
 * loaded.  This means that without the right CORS policy, loading templates from a different domain
 * won't work on all browsers.  Also, loading templates from `file://` URL does not work on some
 * browsers.
 *
 * ## This feels like too much overhead
 *
 * It's important to remember that SCE only applies to interpolation expressions.
 *
 * If your expressions are constant literals, they're automatically trusted and you don't need to
 * call `$sce.trustAs` on them (remember to include the `ngSanitize` module) (e.g.
 * `<div ng-bind-html="'<b>implicitly trusted</b>'"></div>`) just works.
 *
 * Additionally, `a[href]` and `img[src]` automatically sanitize their URLs and do not pass them
 * through {@link ng.$sce#getTrusted $sce.getTrusted}.  SCE doesn't play a role here.
 *
 * The included {@link ng.$sceDelegate $sceDelegate} comes with sane defaults to allow you to load
 * templates in `ng-include` from your application's domain without having to even know about SCE.
 * It blocks loading templates from other domains or loading templates over http from an https
 * served document.  You can change these by setting your own custom {@link
 * ng.$sceDelegateProvider#resourceUrlWhitelist whitelists} and {@link
 * ng.$sceDelegateProvider#resourceUrlBlacklist blacklists} for matching such URLs.
 *
 * This significantly reduces the overhead.  It is far easier to pay the small overhead and have an
 * application that's secure and can be audited to verify that with much more ease than bolting
 * security onto an application later.
 *
 * <a name="contexts"></a>
 * ## What trusted context types are supported?
 *
 * | Context             | Notes          |
 * |---------------------|----------------|
 * | `$sce.HTML`         | For HTML that's safe to source into the application.  The {@link ng.directive:ngBindHtml ngBindHtml} directive uses this context for bindings. If an unsafe value is encountered and the {@link ngSanitize $sanitize} module is present this will sanitize the value instead of throwing an error. |
 * | `$sce.CSS`          | For CSS that's safe to source into the application.  Currently unused.  Feel free to use it in your own directives. |
 * | `$sce.URL`          | For URLs that are safe to follow as links.  Currently unused (`<a href=` and `<img src=` sanitize their urls and don't constitute an SCE context. |
 * | `$sce.RESOURCE_URL` | For URLs that are not only safe to follow as links, but whose contents are also safe to include in your application.  Examples include `ng-include`, `src` / `ngSrc` bindings for tags other than `IMG` (e.g. `IFRAME`, `OBJECT`, etc.)  <br><br>Note that `$sce.RESOURCE_URL` makes a stronger statement about the URL than `$sce.URL` does and therefore contexts requiring values trusted for `$sce.RESOURCE_URL` can be used anywhere that values trusted for `$sce.URL` are required. |
 * | `$sce.JS`           | For JavaScript that is safe to execute in your application's context.  Currently unused.  Feel free to use it in your own directives. |
 *
 * ## Format of items in {@link ng.$sceDelegateProvider#resourceUrlWhitelist resourceUrlWhitelist}/{@link ng.$sceDelegateProvider#resourceUrlBlacklist Blacklist} <a name="resourceUrlPatternItem"></a>
 *
 *  Each element in these arrays must be one of the following:
 *
 *  - **'self'**
 *    - The special **string**, `'self'`, can be used to match against all URLs of the **same
 *      domain** as the application document using the **same protocol**.
 *  - **String** (except the special value `'self'`)
 *    - The string is matched against the full *normalized / absolute URL* of the resource
 *      being tested (substring matches are not good enough.)
 *    - There are exactly **two wildcard sequences** - `*` and `**`.  All other characters
 *      match themselves.
 *    - `*`: matches zero or more occurrences of any character other than one of the following 6
 *      characters: '`:`', '`/`', '`.`', '`?`', '`&`' and ';'.  It's a useful wildcard for use
 *      in a whitelist.
 *    - `**`: matches zero or more occurrences of *any* character.  As such, it's not
 *      not appropriate to use in for a scheme, domain, etc. as it would match too much.  (e.g.
 *      http://**.example.com/ would match http://evil.com/?ignore=.example.com/ and that might
 *      not have been the intention.)  Its usage at the very end of the path is ok.  (e.g.
 *      http://foo.example.com/templates/**).
 *  - **RegExp** (*see caveat below*)
 *    - *Caveat*:  While regular expressions are powerful and offer great flexibility,  their syntax
 *      (and all the inevitable escaping) makes them *harder to maintain*.  It's easy to
 *      accidentally introduce a bug when one updates a complex expression (imho, all regexes should
 *      have good test coverage.).  For instance, the use of `.` in the regex is correct only in a
 *      small number of cases.  A `.` character in the regex used when matching the scheme or a
 *      subdomain could be matched against a `:` or literal `.` that was likely not intended.   It
 *      is highly recommended to use the string patterns and only fall back to regular expressions
 *      if they as a last resort.
 *    - The regular expression must be an instance of RegExp (i.e. not a string.)  It is
 *      matched against the **entire** *normalized / absolute URL* of the resource being tested
 *      (even when the RegExp did not have the `^` and `$` codes.)  In addition, any flags
 *      present on the RegExp (such as multiline, global, ignoreCase) are ignored.
 *    - If you are generating your JavaScript from some other templating engine (not
 *      recommended, e.g. in issue [#4006](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/4006)),
 *      remember to escape your regular expression (and be aware that you might need more than
 *      one level of escaping depending on your templating engine and the way you interpolated
 *      the value.)  Do make use of your platform's escaping mechanism as it might be good
 *      enough before coding your own.  e.g. Ruby has
 *      [Regexp.escape(str)](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.0.0/Regexp.html#method-c-escape)
 *      and Python has [re.escape](http://docs.python.org/library/re.html#re.escape).
 *      Javascript lacks a similar built in function for escaping.  Take a look at Google
 *      Closure library's [goog.string.regExpEscape(s)](
 *      http://docs.closure-library.googlecode.com/git/closure_goog_string_string.js.source.html#line962).

 * ## Can I disable SCE completely?

 * Yes, you can.  However, this is strongly discouraged.  SCE gives you a lot of security benefits
 * for little coding overhead.  It will be much harder to take an SCE disabled application and
 * either secure it on your own or enable SCE at a later stage.  It might make sense to disable SCE
 * for cases where you have a lot of existing code that was written before SCE was introduced and
 * you're migrating them a module at a time.
 *
 * That said, here's how you can completely disable SCE:
 *
 * ```
 * angular.module('myAppWithSceDisabledmyApp', []).config(function($sceProvider) {
 *   // Completely disable SCE.  For demonstration purposes only!
 *   // Do not use in new projects.
 *   $sceProvider.enabled(false);
 * });
 * ```

  /* Design notes on the default implementation for SCE.
   *
   * The API contract for the SCE delegate
   * -------------------------------------
   * The SCE delegate object must provide the following 3 methods:
   *
   * - trustAs(contextEnum, value)
   *     This method is used to tell the SCE service that the provided value is OK to use in the
   *     contexts specified by contextEnum.  It must return an object that will be accepted by
   *     getTrusted() for a compatible contextEnum and return this value.
   *
   * - valueOf(value)
   *     For values that were not produced by trustAs(), return them as is.  For values that were
   *     produced by trustAs(), return the corresponding input value to trustAs.  Basically, if
   *     trustAs is wrapping the given values into some type, this operation unwraps it when given
   *     such a value.
   *
   * - getTrusted(contextEnum, value)
   *     This function should return the a value that is safe to use in the context specified by
   *     contextEnum or throw and exception otherwise.
   *
   * NOTE: This contract deliberately does NOT state that values returned by trustAs() must be
   * opaque or wrapped in some holder object.  That happens to be an implementation detail.  For
   * instance, an implementation could maintain a registry of all trusted objects by context.  In
   * such a case, trustAs() would return the same object that was passed in.  getTrusted() would
   * return the same object passed in if it was found in the registry under a compatible context or
   * throw an exception otherwise.  An implementation might only wrap values some of the time based
   * on some criteria.  getTrusted() might return a value and not throw an exception for special
   * constants or objects even if not wrapped.  All such implementations fulfill this contract.
   *
   *
   * A note on the inheritance model for SCE contexts
   * ------------------------------------------------
   * I've used inheritance and made RESOURCE_URL wrapped types a subtype of URL wrapped types.  This
   * is purely an implementation details.
   *
   * The contract is simply this:
   *
   *     getTrusted($sce.RESOURCE_URL, value) succeeding implies that getTrusted($sce.URL, value)
   *     will also succeed.
   *
   * Inheritance happens to capture this in a natural way.  In some future, we
   * may not use inheritance anymore.  That is OK because no code outside of
   * sce.js and sceSpecs.js would need to be aware of this detail.

/**
 *
 * Implementation Notes for non-IE browsers
 * ----------------------------------------
 * Assigning a URL to the href property of an anchor DOM node, even one attached to the DOM,
 * results both in the normalizing and parsing of the URL.  Normalizing means that a relative
 * URL will be resolved into an absolute URL in the context of the application document.
 * Parsing means that the anchor node's host, hostname, protocol, port, pathname and related
 * properties are all populated to reflect the normalized URL.  This approach has wide
 * compatibility - Safari 1+, Mozilla 1+, Opera 7+,e etc.  See
 * http://www.aptana.com/reference/html/api/HTMLAnchorElement.html
 *
 * Implementation Notes for IE
 * ---------------------------
 * IE >= 8 and <= 10 normalizes the URL when assigned to the anchor node similar to the other
 * browsers.  However, the parsed components will not be set if the URL assigned did not specify
 * them.  (e.g. if you assign a.href = "foo", then a.protocol, a.host, etc. will be empty.)  We
 * work around that by performing the parsing in a 2nd step by taking a previously normalized
 * URL (e.g. by assigning to a.href) and assigning it a.href again.  This correctly populates the
 * properties such as protocol, hostname, port, etc.
 *
 * IE7 does not normalize the URL when assigned to an anchor node.  (Apparently, it does, if one
 * uses the inner HTML approach to assign the URL as part of an HTML snippet -
 * http://stackoverflow.com/a/472729)  However, setting img[src] does normalize the URL.
 * Unfortunately, setting img[src] to something like "javascript:foo" on IE throws an exception.
 * Since the primary usage for normalizing URLs is to sanitize such URLs, we can't use that
 * method and IE < 8 is unsupported.

 *
 * ```js
 *   // Filter registration
 *   function MyModule($provide, $filterProvider) {
 *     // create a service to demonstrate injection (not always needed)
 *     $provide.value('greet', function(name){

 *     $filterProvider.register('greet', function(greet){
 *       // return the filter function which uses the greet service
 *       // to generate salutation
 *       return function(text) {
 *         // filters need to be forgiving so check input validity
 *         return text && greet(text) || text;
 *       };
 *     });
 *   }
 * ```
 *
 * The filter function is registered with the `$injector` under the filter name suffix with
 * `Filter`.
 *
 * ```js
 *   it('should be the same instance', inject(
 *     function($filterProvider) {
 *       $filterProvider.register('reverse', function(){

/**
 * @ngdoc filter
 * @name filter
 * @kind function
 *
 * @description
 * Selects a subset of items from `array` and returns it as a new array.
 *
 * @param {Array} array The source array.
 * @param {string|Object|function()} expression The predicate to be used for selecting items from
 *   `array`.
 *
 *   Can be one of:
 *
 *   - `string`: The string is evaluated as an expression and the resulting value is used for substring match against
 *     the contents of the `array`. All strings or objects with string properties in `array` that contain this string
 *     will be returned. The predicate can be negated by prefixing the string with `!`.
 *
 *   - `Object`: A pattern object can be used to filter specific properties on objects contained
 *     by `array`. For example `{name:"M", phone:"1"}` predicate will return an array of items
 *     which have property `name` containing "M" and property `phone` containing "1". A special
 *     property name `$` can be used (as in `{$:"text"}`) to accept a match against any
 *     property of the object. That's equivalent to the simple substring match with a `string`
 *     as described above. The predicate can be negated by prefixing the string with `!`.
 *     For Example `{name: "!M"}` predicate will return an array of items which have property `name`
 *     not containing "M".
 *
 *   - `function(value, index)`: A predicate function can be used to write arbitrary filters. The
 *     function is called for each element of `array`. The final result is an array of those
 *     elements that the predicate returned true for.
 *
 * @param {function(actual, expected)|true|undefined} comparator Comparator which is used in
 *     determining if the expected value (from the filter expression) and actual value (from
 *     the object in the array) should be considered a match.
 *
 *   Can be one of:
 *
 *   - `function(actual, expected)`:
 *     The function will be given the object value and the predicate value to compare and
 *     should return true if the item should be included in filtered result.
 *
 *   - `true`: A shorthand for `function(actual, expected) { return angular.equals(expected, actual)}`.
 *     this is essentially strict comparison of expected and actual.
 *
 *   - `false|undefined`: A short hand for a function which will look for a substring match in case
 *     insensitive way.

 *   * `'m'`: Minute in hour (0-59)
 *   * `'ss'`: Second in minute, padded (00-59)

 *
 *   `format` string can also be one of the following predefined
 *   {@link guide/i18n localizable formats}:
 *
 *   * `'medium'`: equivalent to `'MMM d, y h:mm:ss a'` for en_US locale
 *     (e.g. Sep 3, 2010 12:05:08 PM)
 *   * `'short'`: equivalent to `'M/d/yy h:mm a'` for en_US  locale (e.g. 9/3/10 12:05 PM)

 *   * `'mediumDate'`: equivalent to `'MMM d, y'` for en_US  locale (e.g. Sep 3, 2010)
 *   * `'shortDate'`: equivalent to `'M/d/yy'` for en_US locale (e.g. 9/3/10)
 *   * `'mediumTime'`: equivalent to `'h:mm:ss a'` for en_US locale (e.g. 12:05:08 PM)
 *   * `'shortTime'`: equivalent to `'h:mm a'` for en_US locale (e.g. 12:05 PM)
 *
 *   `format` string can contain literal values. These need to be escaped by surrounding with single quotes (e.g.
 *   `"h 'in the morning'"`). In order to output a single quote, escape it - i.e., two single quotes in a sequence
 *   (e.g. `"h 'o''clock'"`).
 *
 * @param {(Date|number|string)} date Date to format either as Date object, milliseconds (string or
 *    number) or various ISO 8601 datetime string formats (e.g. yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.sssZ and its
 *    shorter versions like yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mmZ, yyyy-MM-dd or yyyyMMddTHHmmssZ). If no timezone is
 *    specified in the string input, the time is considered to be in the local timezone.
 * @param {string=} format Formatting rules (see Description). If not specified,
 *    `mediumDate` is used.
 * @param {string=} timezone Timezone to be used for formatting. Right now, only `'UTC'` is supported.
 *    If not specified, the timezone of the browser will be used.
 * @returns {string} Formatted string or the input if input is not recognized as date/millis.

/**
 * @ngdoc filter
 * @name orderBy
 * @kind function
 *
 * @description
 * Orders a specified `array` by the `expression` predicate. It is ordered alphabetically
 * for strings and numerically for numbers. Note: if you notice numbers are not being sorted
 * correctly, make sure they are actually being saved as numbers and not strings.
 *
 * @param {Array} array The array to sort.
 * @param {function(*)|string|Array.<(function(*)|string)>=} expression A predicate to be
 *    used by the comparator to determine the order of elements.
 *
 *    Can be one of:
 *
 *    - `function`: Getter function. The result of this function will be sorted using the
 *      `<`, `=`, `>` operator.
 *    - `string`: An Angular expression. The result of this expression is used to compare elements
 *      (for example `name` to sort by a property called `name` or `name.substr(0, 3)` to sort by
 *      3 first characters of a property called `name`). The result of a constant expression
 *      is interpreted as a property name to be used in comparisons (for example `"special name"`
 *      to sort object by the value of their `special name` property). An expression can be
 *      optionally prefixed with `+` or `-` to control ascending or descending sort order
 *      (for example, `+name` or `-name`). If no property is provided, (e.g. `'+'`) then the array
 *      element itself is used to compare where sorting.
 *    - `Array`: An array of function or string predicates. The first predicate in the array
 *      is used for sorting, but when two items are equivalent, the next predicate is used.
 *
 *    If the predicate is missing or empty then it defaults to `'+'`.
 *
 * @param {boolean=} reverse Reverse the order of the array.
 * @returns {Array} Sorted copy of the source array.

 *                       related scope, under this name.

 */

 /**
 * @ngdoc directive
 * @name form
 * @restrict E
 *
 * @description
 * Directive that instantiates
 * {@link form.FormController FormController}.
 *
 * If the `name` attribute is specified, the form controller is published onto the current scope under
 * this name.
 *
 * # Alias: {@link ng.directive:ngForm `ngForm`}
 *
 * In Angular forms can be nested. This means that the outer form is valid when all of the child
 * forms are valid as well. However, browsers do not allow nesting of `<form>` elements, so
 * Angular provides the {@link ng.directive:ngForm `ngForm`} directive which behaves identically to
 * `<form>` but can be nested.  This allows you to have nested forms, which is very useful when
 * using Angular validation directives in forms that are dynamically generated using the
 * {@link ng.directive:ngRepeat `ngRepeat`} directive. Since you cannot dynamically generate the `name`
 * attribute of input elements using interpolation, you have to wrap each set of repeated inputs in an
 * `ngForm` directive and nest these in an outer `form` element.
 *
 *
 * # CSS classes
 *  - `ng-valid` is set if the form is valid.
 *  - `ng-invalid` is set if the form is invalid.
 *  - `ng-pristine` is set if the form is pristine.
 *  - `ng-dirty` is set if the form is dirty.
 *  - `ng-submitted` is set if the form was submitted.
 *
 * Keep in mind that ngAnimate can detect each of these classes when added and removed.
 *
 *
 * # Submitting a form and preventing the default action
 *
 * Since the role of forms in client-side Angular applications is different than in classical
 * roundtrip apps, it is desirable for the browser not to translate the form submission into a full
 * page reload that sends the data to the server. Instead some javascript logic should be triggered
 * to handle the form submission in an application-specific way.
 *
 * For this reason, Angular prevents the default action (form submission to the server) unless the
 * `<form>` element has an `action` attribute specified.
 *
 * You can use one of the following two ways to specify what javascript method should be called when
 * a form is submitted:
 *
 * - {@link ng.directive:ngSubmit ngSubmit} directive on the form element
 * - {@link ng.directive:ngClick ngClick} directive on the first
  *  button or input field of type submit (input[type=submit])
 *
 * To prevent double execution of the handler, use only one of the {@link ng.directive:ngSubmit ngSubmit}
 * or {@link ng.directive:ngClick ngClick} directives.
 * This is because of the following form submission rules in the HTML specification:
 *
 * - If a form has only one input field then hitting enter in this field triggers form submit
 * (`ngSubmit`)
 * - if a form has 2+ input fields and no buttons or input[type=submit] then hitting enter
 * doesn't trigger submit
 * - if a form has one or more input fields and one or more buttons or input[type=submit] then
 * hitting enter in any of the input fields will trigger the click handler on the *first* button or
 * input[type=submit] (`ngClick`) *and* a submit handler on the enclosing form (`ngSubmit`)
 *
 * Any pending `ngModelOptions` changes will take place immediately when an enclosing form is
 * submitted. Note that `ngClick` events will occur before the model is updated. Use `ngSubmit`
 * to have access to the updated model.
 *
 * ## Animation Hooks
 *
 * Animations in ngForm are triggered when any of the associated CSS classes are added and removed.
 * These classes are: `.ng-pristine`, `.ng-dirty`, `.ng-invalid` and `.ng-valid` as well as any
 * other validations that are performed within the form. Animations in ngForm are similar to how
 * they work in ngClass and animations can be hooked into using CSS transitions, keyframes as well
 * as JS animations.
 *
 * The following example shows a simple way to utilize CSS transitions to style a form element
 * that has been rendered as invalid after it has been validated:
 *
 * <pre>
 * //be sure to include ngAnimate as a module to hook into more
 * //advanced animations
 * .my-form {
 *   transition:0.5s linear all;
 *   background: white;
 * }
 * .my-form.ng-invalid {
 *   background: red;
 *   color:white;
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * @example
    <example deps="angular-animate.js" animations="true" fixBase="true" module="formExample">
      <file name="index.html">
       <script>
         angular.module('formExample', [])

             $scope.userType = 'guest';
           }]);
       </script>
       <style>
        .my-form {
          -webkit-transition:all linear 0.5s;
          transition:all linear 0.5s;
          background: transparent;
        }
        .my-form.ng-invalid {
          background: red;
        }
       </style>
       <form name="myForm" ng-controller="FormController" class="my-form">
         userType: <input name="input" ng-model="userType" required>
         <span class="error" ng-show="myForm.input.$error.required">Required!</span><br>

   * @ngdoc input

   *
   * @description
   * Text input with number validation and transformation. Sets the `number` validation
   * error if not a valid number.
   *
   * The model must always be a number, otherwise Angular will throw an error.
   *
   * @param {string} ngModel Assignable angular expression to data-bind to.
   * @param {string=} name Property name of the form under which the control is published.
   * @param {string=} min Sets the `min` validation error key if the value entered is less than `min`.
   * @param {string=} max Sets the `max` validation error key if the value entered is greater than `max`.
   * @param {string=} required Sets `required` validation error key if the value is not entered.
   * @param {string=} ngRequired Adds `required` attribute and `required` validation constraint to
   *    the element when the ngRequired expression evaluates to true. Use `ngRequired` instead of
   *    `required` when you want to data-bind to the `required` attribute.
   * @param {number=} ngMinlength Sets `minlength` validation error key if the value is shorter than
   *    minlength.
   * @param {number=} ngMaxlength Sets `maxlength` validation error key if the value is longer than
   *    maxlength. Setting the attribute to a negative or non-numeric value, allows view values of
   *    any length.
   * @param {string=} pattern Similar to `ngPattern` except that the attribute value is the actual string
   *    that contains the regular expression body that will be converted to a regular expression
   *    as in the ngPattern directive.
   * @param {string=} ngPattern Sets `pattern` validation error key if the ngModel value does not match
   *    a RegExp found by evaluating the Angular expression given in the attribute value.
   *    If the expression evaluates to a RegExp object then this is used directly.
   *    If the expression is a string then it will be converted to a RegExp after wrapping it in `^` and `$`
   *    characters. For instance, `"abc"` will be converted to `new RegExp('^abc$')`.
   * @param {string=} ngChange Angular expression to be executed when input changes due to user
   *    interaction with the input element.

/**
 * @ngdoc type
 * @name ngModel.NgModelController
 *
 * @property {string} $viewValue Actual string value in the view.
 * @property {*} $modelValue The value in the model that the control is bound to.
 * @property {Array.<Function>} $parsers Array of functions to execute, as a pipeline, whenever
       the control reads value from the DOM. The functions are called in array order, each passing
       its return value through to the next. The last return value is forwarded to the
       {@link ngModel.NgModelController#$validators `$validators`} collection.

Parsers are used to sanitize / convert the {@link ngModel.NgModelController#$viewValue
`$viewValue`}.

Returning `undefined` from a parser means a parse error occurred. In that case,
no {@link ngModel.NgModelController#$validators `$validators`} will run and the `ngModel`
will be set to `undefined` unless {@link ngModelOptions `ngModelOptions.allowInvalid`}
is set to `true`. The parse error is stored in `ngModel.$error.parse`.

 *
 * @property {Array.<Function>} $formatters Array of functions to execute, as a pipeline, whenever
       the model value changes. The functions are called in reverse array order, each passing the value through to the
       next. The last return value is used as the actual DOM value.
       Used to format / convert values for display in the control.
 * ```js
 * function formatter(value) {
 *   if (value) {
 *     return value.toUpperCase();
 *   }
 * }
 * ngModel.$formatters.push(formatter);
 * ```
 *
 * @property {Object.<string, function>} $validators A collection of validators that are applied
 *      whenever the model value changes. The key value within the object refers to the name of the
 *      validator while the function refers to the validation operation. The validation operation is
 *      provided with the model value as an argument and must return a true or false value depending
 *      on the response of that validation.
 *
 * ```js
 * ngModel.$validators.validCharacters = function(modelValue, viewValue) {
 *   var value = modelValue || viewValue;
 *   return /[0-9]+/.test(value) &&
 *          /[a-z]+/.test(value) &&
 *          /[A-Z]+/.test(value) &&
 *          /\W+/.test(value);
 * };
 * ```
 *
 * @property {Object.<string, function>} $asyncValidators A collection of validations that are expected to
 *      perform an asynchronous validation (e.g. a HTTP request). The validation function that is provided
 *      is expected to return a promise when it is run during the model validation process. Once the promise
 *      is delivered then the validation status will be set to true when fulfilled and false when rejected.
 *      When the asynchronous validators are triggered, each of the validators will run in parallel and the model
 *      value will only be updated once all validators have been fulfilled. As long as an asynchronous validator
 *      is unfulfilled, its key will be added to the controllers `$pending` property. Also, all asynchronous validators
 *      will only run once all synchronous validators have passed.
 *
 * Please note that if $http is used then it is important that the server returns a success HTTP response code
 * in order to fulfill the validation and a status level of `4xx` in order to reject the validation.
 *
 * ```js
 * ngModel.$asyncValidators.uniqueUsername = function(modelValue, viewValue) {
 *   var value = modelValue || viewValue;
 *
 *   // Lookup user by username
 *   return $http.get('/api/users/' + value).
 *      then(function resolved() {
 *        //username exists, this means validation fails
 *        return $q.reject('exists');
 *      }, function rejected() {
 *        //username does not exist, therefore this validation passes
 *        return true;
 *      });
 * };
 * ```
 *
 * @property {Array.<Function>} $viewChangeListeners Array of functions to execute whenever the
 *     view value has changed. It is called with no arguments, and its return value is ignored.
 *     This can be used in place of additional $watches against the model value.
 *
 * @property {Object} $error An object hash with all failing validator ids as keys.
 * @property {Object} $pending An object hash with all pending validator ids as keys.
 *
 * @property {boolean} $untouched True if control has not lost focus yet.
 * @property {boolean} $touched True if control has lost focus.
 * @property {boolean} $pristine True if user has not interacted with the control yet.
 * @property {boolean} $dirty True if user has already interacted with the control.

 *
 * `NgModelController` provides API for the {@link ngModel `ngModel`} directive.
 * The controller contains services for data-binding, validation, CSS updates, and value formatting
 * and parsing. It purposefully does not contain any logic which deals with DOM rendering or
 * listening to DOM events.
 * Such DOM related logic should be provided by other directives which make use of
 * `NgModelController` for data-binding to control elements.
 * Angular provides this DOM logic for most {@link input `input`} elements.
 * At the end of this page you can find a {@link ngModel.NgModelController#custom-control-example
 * custom control example} that uses `ngModelController` to bind to `contenteditable` elements.
 *
 * @example
 * ### Custom Control Example
 * This example shows how to use `NgModelController` with a custom control to achieve
 * data-binding. Notice how different directives (`contenteditable`, `ng-model`, and `required`)
 * collaborate together to achieve the desired result.
 *
 * Note that `contenteditable` is an HTML5 attribute, which tells the browser to let the element
 * contents be edited in place by the user.  This will not work on older browsers.
 *
 * We are using the {@link ng.service:$sce $sce} service here and include the {@link ngSanitize $sanitize}
 * module to automatically remove "bad" content like inline event listener (e.g. `<span onclick="...">`).
 * However, as we are using `$sce` the model can still decide to provide unsafe content if it marks
 * that content using the `$sce` service.
 *
 * <example name="NgModelController" module="customControl" deps="angular-sanitize.js">
    <file name="style.css">
      [contenteditable] {
        border: 1px solid black;
        background-color: white;
        min-height: 20px;

   * @ngdoc method
   * @name ngModel.NgModelController#$setViewValue
   *
   * @description
   * Update the view value.
   *
   * This method should be called when an input directive want to change the view value; typically,
   * this is done from within a DOM event handler.
   *
   * For example {@link ng.directive:input input} calls it when the value of the input changes and
   * {@link ng.directive:select select} calls it when an option is selected.
   *
   * If the new `value` is an object (rather than a string or a number), we should make a copy of the
   * object before passing it to `$setViewValue`.  This is because `ngModel` does not perform a deep
   * watch of objects, it only looks for a change of identity. If you only change the property of
   * the object then ngModel will not realise that the object has changed and will not invoke the
   * `$parsers` and `$validators` pipelines.
   *
   * For this reason, you should not change properties of the copy once it has been passed to
   * `$setViewValue`. Otherwise you may cause the model value on the scope to change incorrectly.
   *
   * When this method is called, the new `value` will be staged for committing through the `$parsers`
   * and `$validators` pipelines. If there are no special {@link ngModelOptions} specified then the staged
   * value sent directly for processing, finally to be applied to `$modelValue` and then the
   * **expression** specified in the `ng-model` attribute.
   *
   * Lastly, all the registered change listeners, in the `$viewChangeListeners` list, are called.
   *
   * In case the {@link ng.directive:ngModelOptions ngModelOptions} directive is used with `updateOn`
   * and the `default` trigger is not listed, all those actions will remain pending until one of the
   * `updateOn` events is triggered on the DOM element.
   * All these actions will be debounced if the {@link ng.directive:ngModelOptions ngModelOptions}
   * directive is used with a custom debounce for this particular event.
   *
   * Note that calling this function does not trigger a `$digest`.
   *
   * @param {string} value Value from the view.
   * @param {string} trigger Event that triggered the update.

/**
 * @ngdoc directive
 * @name ngModel
 *
 * @element input
 * @priority 1
 *
 * @description
 * The `ngModel` directive binds an `input`,`select`, `textarea` (or custom form control) to a
 * property on the scope using {@link ngModel.NgModelController NgModelController},
 * which is created and exposed by this directive.
 *
 * `ngModel` is responsible for:
 *
 * - Binding the view into the model, which other directives such as `input`, `textarea` or `select`
 *   require.
 * - Providing validation behavior (i.e. required, number, email, url).
 * - Keeping the state of the control (valid/invalid, dirty/pristine, touched/untouched, validation errors).
 * - Setting related css classes on the element (`ng-valid`, `ng-invalid`, `ng-dirty`, `ng-pristine`, `ng-touched`, `ng-untouched`) including animations.
 * - Registering the control with its parent {@link ng.directive:form form}.
 *
 * Note: `ngModel` will try to bind to the property given by evaluating the expression on the
 * current scope. If the property doesn't already exist on this scope, it will be created
 * implicitly and added to the scope.
 *
 * For best practices on using `ngModel`, see:
 *
 *  - [Understanding Scopes](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/wiki/Understanding-Scopes)
 *
 * For basic examples, how to use `ngModel`, see:
 *
 *  - {@link ng.directive:input input}
 *    - {@link input[text] text}
 *    - {@link input[checkbox] checkbox}
 *    - {@link input[radio] radio}
 *    - {@link input[number] number}
 *    - {@link input[email] email}
 *    - {@link input[url] url}
 *    - {@link input[date] date}
 *    - {@link input[datetime-local] datetime-local}
 *    - {@link input[time] time}
 *    - {@link input[month] month}
 *    - {@link input[week] week}
 *  - {@link ng.directive:select select}
 *  - {@link ng.directive:textarea textarea}
 *
 * # CSS classes
 * The following CSS classes are added and removed on the associated input/select/textarea element
 * depending on the validity of the model.
 *
 *  - `ng-valid`: the model is valid
 *  - `ng-invalid`: the model is invalid
 *  - `ng-valid-[key]`: for each valid key added by `$setValidity`
 *  - `ng-invalid-[key]`: for each invalid key added by `$setValidity`
 *  - `ng-pristine`: the control hasn't been interacted with yet
 *  - `ng-dirty`: the control has been interacted with
 *  - `ng-touched`: the control has been blurred
 *  - `ng-untouched`: the control hasn't been blurred
 *  - `ng-pending`: any `$asyncValidators` are unfulfilled
 *
 * Keep in mind that ngAnimate can detect each of these classes when added and removed.
 *
 * ## Animation Hooks
 *
 * Animations within models are triggered when any of the associated CSS classes are added and removed
 * on the input element which is attached to the model. These classes are: `.ng-pristine`, `.ng-dirty`,
 * `.ng-invalid` and `.ng-valid` as well as any other validations that are performed on the model itself.
 * The animations that are triggered within ngModel are similar to how they work in ngClass and
 * animations can be hooked into using CSS transitions, keyframes as well as JS animations.
 *
 * The following example shows a simple way to utilize CSS transitions to style an input element
 * that has been rendered as invalid after it has been validated:
 *
 * <pre>
 * //be sure to include ngAnimate as a module to hook into more
 * //advanced animations
 * .my-input {
 *   transition:0.5s linear all;
 *   background: white;
 * }
 * .my-input.ng-invalid {
 *   background: red;
 *   color:white;
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * @example
 * <example deps="angular-animate.js" animations="true" fixBase="true" module="inputExample">
     <file name="index.html">
       <script>
        angular.module('inputExample', [])
          .controller('ExampleController', ['$scope', function($scope) {
            $scope.val = '1';
          }]);
       </script>
       <style>
         .my-input {
           -webkit-transition:all linear 0.5s;
           transition:all linear 0.5s;
           background: transparent;
         }
         .my-input.ng-invalid {
           color:white;
           background: red;
         }
       </style>
       Update input to see transitions when valid/invalid.
       Integer is a valid value.
       <form name="testForm" ng-controller="ExampleController">
         <input ng-model="val" ng-pattern="/^\d+$/" name="anim" class="my-input" />
       </form>
     </file>
 * </example>
 *
 * ## Binding to a getter/setter
 *
 * Sometimes it's helpful to bind `ngModel` to a getter/setter function.  A getter/setter is a
 * function that returns a representation of the model when called with zero arguments, and sets
 * the internal state of a model when called with an argument. It's sometimes useful to use this
 * for models that have an internal representation that's different than what the model exposes
 * to the view.
 *
 * <div class="alert alert-success">
 * **Best Practice:** It's best to keep getters fast because Angular is likely to call them more
 * frequently than other parts of your code.
 * </div>
 *
 * You use this behavior by adding `ng-model-options="{ getterSetter: true }"` to an element that
 * has `ng-model` attached to it. You can also add `ng-model-options="{ getterSetter: true }"` to
 * a `<form>`, which will enable this behavior for all `<input>`s within it. See
 * {@link ng.directive:ngModelOptions `ngModelOptions`} for more.
 *
 * The following example shows how to use `ngModel` with a getter/setter:
 *
 * @example
 * <example name="ngModel-getter-setter" module="getterSetterExample">
     <file name="index.html">
       <div ng-controller="ExampleController">
         <form name="userForm">
           Name:
           <input type="text" name="userName"
                  ng-model="user.name"
                  ng-model-options="{ getterSetter: true }" />
         </form>
         <pre>user.name = <span ng-bind="user.name()"></span></pre>
       </div>
     </file>
     <file name="app.js">
       angular.module('getterSetterExample', [])
         .controller('ExampleController', ['$scope', function($scope) {
           var _name = 'Brian';
           $scope.user = {
             name: function(newName) {
               if (angular.isDefined(newName)) {
                 _name = newName;
               }
               return _name;
             }
           };
         }]);
     </file>

/**
 * @ngdoc directive
 * @name ngList
 *
 * @description
 * Text input that converts between a delimited string and an array of strings. The default
 * delimiter is a comma followed by a space - equivalent to `ng-list=", "`. You can specify a custom
 * delimiter as the value of the `ngList` attribute - for example, `ng-list=" | "`.
 *
 * The behaviour of the directive is affected by the use of the `ngTrim` attribute.
 * * If `ngTrim` is set to `"false"` then whitespace around both the separator and each
 *   list item is respected. This implies that the user of the directive is responsible for
 *   dealing with whitespace but also allows you to use whitespace as a delimiter, such as a
 *   tab or newline character.
 * * Otherwise whitespace around the delimiter is ignored when splitting (although it is respected
 *   when joining the list items back together) and whitespace around each list item is stripped
 *   before it is added to the model.

 * Likewise, `ngValue` can be used to generate `<option>` elements for

/**
 * @ngdoc directive
 * @name ngModelOptions
 *
 * @description
 * Allows tuning how model updates are done. Using `ngModelOptions` you can specify a custom list of
 * events that will trigger a model update and/or a debouncing delay so that the actual update only
 * takes place when a timer expires; this timer will be reset after another change takes place.
 *
 * Given the nature of `ngModelOptions`, the value displayed inside input fields in the view might
 * be different than the value in the actual model. This means that if you update the model you
 * should also invoke {@link ngModel.NgModelController `$rollbackViewValue`} on the relevant input field in
 * order to make sure it is synchronized with the model and that any debounced action is canceled.
 *
 * The easiest way to reference the control's {@link ngModel.NgModelController `$rollbackViewValue`}
 * method is by making sure the input is placed inside a form that has a `name` attribute. This is
 * important because `form` controllers are published to the related scope under the name in their
 * `name` attribute.
 *
 * Any pending changes will take place immediately when an enclosing form is submitted via the
 * `submit` event. Note that `ngClick` events will occur before the model is updated. Use `ngSubmit`
 * to have access to the updated model.
 *
 * `ngModelOptions` has an effect on the element it's declared on and its descendants.
 *
 * @param {Object} ngModelOptions options to apply to the current model. Valid keys are:
 *   - `updateOn`: string specifying which event should the input be bound to. You can set several
 *     events using an space delimited list. There is a special event called `default` that
 *     matches the default events belonging of the control.
 *   - `debounce`: integer value which contains the debounce model update value in milliseconds. A
 *     value of 0 triggers an immediate update. If an object is supplied instead, you can specify a
 *     custom value for each event. For example:
 *     `ng-model-options="{ updateOn: 'default blur', debounce: {'default': 500, 'blur': 0} }"`
 *   - `allowInvalid`: boolean value which indicates that the model can be set with values that did
 *     not validate correctly instead of the default behavior of setting the model to undefined.
 *   - `getterSetter`: boolean value which determines whether or not to treat functions bound to
       `ngModel` as getters/setters.
 *   - `timezone`: Defines the timezone to be used to read/write the `Date` instance in the model for
 *     `<input type="date">`, `<input type="time">`, ... . Right now, the only supported value is `'UTC'`,
 *     otherwise the default timezone of the browser will be used.
 *
 * @example

  The following example shows how to override immediate updates. Changes on the inputs within the
  form will update the model only when the control loses focus (blur event). If `escape` key is
  pressed while the input field is focused, the value is reset to the value in the current model.

  <example name="ngModelOptions-directive-blur" module="optionsExample">
    <file name="index.html">

  This one shows how to debounce model changes. Model will be updated only 1 sec after last change.
  If the `Clear` button is pressed, any debounced action is canceled and the value becomes empty.

 * @ngdoc directive

 *
 * @description
 * The `ngBind` attribute tells Angular to replace the text content of the specified HTML element
 * with the value of a given expression, and to update the text content when the value of that
 * expression changes.
 *
 * Typically, you don't use `ngBind` directly, but instead you use the double curly markup like
 * `{{ expression }}` which is similar but less verbose.
 *
 * It is preferable to use `ngBind` instead of `{{ expression }}` if a template is momentarily
 * displayed by the browser in its raw state before Angular compiles it. Since `ngBind` is an
 * element attribute, it makes the bindings invisible to the user while the page is loading.
 *
 * An alternative solution to this problem would be using the
 * {@link ng.directive:ngCloak ngCloak} directive.
 *
 *
 * @element ANY
 * @param {expression} ngBind {@link guide/expression Expression} to evaluate.

/**
 * @ngdoc directive
 * @name ngClass
 * @restrict AC
 *
 * @description
 * The `ngClass` directive allows you to dynamically set CSS classes on an HTML element by databinding
 * an expression that represents all classes to be added.
 *
 * The directive operates in three different ways, depending on which of three types the expression
 * evaluates to:
 *
 * 1. If the expression evaluates to a string, the string should be one or more space-delimited class
 * names.
 *
 * 2. If the expression evaluates to an array, each element of the array should be a string that is
 * one or more space-delimited class names.
 *
 * 3. If the expression evaluates to an object, then for each key-value pair of the
 * object with a truthy value the corresponding key is used as a class name.
 *
 * The directive won't add duplicate classes if a particular class was already set.
 *
 * When the expression changes, the previously added classes are removed and only then the
 * new classes are added.
 *
 * @animations
 * add - happens just before the class is applied to the element
 * remove - happens just before the class is removed from the element
 *
 * @element ANY
 * @param {expression} ngClass {@link guide/expression Expression} to eval. The result
 *   of the evaluation can be a string representing space delimited class
 *   names, an array, or a map of class names to boolean values. In the case of a map, the
 *   names of the properties whose values are truthy will be added as css classes to the
 *   element.
 *
 * @example Example that demonstrates basic bindings via ngClass directive.
   <example>
     <file name="index.html">
       <p ng-class="{strike: deleted, bold: important, red: error}">Map Syntax Example</p>
       <input type="checkbox" ng-model="deleted"> deleted (apply "strike" class)<br>
       <input type="checkbox" ng-model="important"> important (apply "bold" class)<br>
       <input type="checkbox" ng-model="error"> error (apply "red" class)

   ## Animations

   The example below demonstrates how to perform animations using ngClass.

   <example module="ngAnimate" deps="angular-animate.js" animations="true">
     <file name="index.html">
      <input id="setbtn" type="button" value="set" ng-click="myVar='my-class'">
      <input id="clearbtn" type="button" value="clear" ng-click="myVar=''">
      <br>
      <span class="base-class" ng-class="myVar">Sample Text</span>
     </file>
     <file name="style.css">
       .base-class {
         -webkit-transition:all cubic-bezier(0.250, 0.460, 0.450, 0.940) 0.5s;
         transition:all cubic-bezier(0.250, 0.460, 0.450, 0.940) 0.5s;
       }

       .base-class.my-class {
         color: red;
         font-size:3em;
       }
     </file>
     <file name="protractor.js" type="protractor">
       it('should check ng-class', function() {
         expect(element(by.css('.base-class')).getAttribute('class')).not.
           toMatch(/my-class/);

         element(by.id('setbtn')).click();

         expect(element(by.css('.base-class')).getAttribute('class')).
           toMatch(/my-class/);

         element(by.id('clearbtn')).click();

         expect(element(by.css('.base-class')).getAttribute('class')).not.
           toMatch(/my-class/);
       });
     </file>
   </example>


   ## ngClass and pre-existing CSS3 Transitions/Animations
   The ngClass directive still supports CSS3 Transitions/Animations even if they do not follow the ngAnimate CSS naming structure.
   Upon animation ngAnimate will apply supplementary CSS classes to track the start and end of an animation, but this will not hinder
   any pre-existing CSS transitions already on the element. To get an idea of what happens during a class-based animation, be sure
   to view the step by step details of {@link ng.$animate#addClass $animate.addClass} and
   {@link ng.$animate#removeClass $animate.removeClass}.

/**
 * @ngdoc directive
 * @name ngCloak
 * @restrict AC
 *
 * @description
 * The `ngCloak` directive is used to prevent the Angular html template from being briefly
 * displayed by the browser in its raw (uncompiled) form while your application is loading. Use this
 * directive to avoid the undesirable flicker effect caused by the html template display.
 *
 * The directive can be applied to the `<body>` element, but the preferred usage is to apply
 * multiple `ngCloak` directives to small portions of the page to permit progressive rendering
 * of the browser view.
 *
 * `ngCloak` works in cooperation with the following css rule embedded within `angular.js` and
 * `angular.min.js`.
 * For CSP mode please add `angular-csp.css` to your html file (see {@link ng.directive:ngCsp ngCsp}).
 *
 * ```css
 * [ng\:cloak], [ng-cloak], [data-ng-cloak], [x-ng-cloak], .ng-cloak, .x-ng-cloak {
 *   display: none !important;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * When this css rule is loaded by the browser, all html elements (including their children) that
 * are tagged with the `ngCloak` directive are hidden. When Angular encounters this directive
 * during the compilation of the template it deletes the `ngCloak` element attribute, making
 * the compiled element visible.
 *
 * For the best result, the `angular.js` script must be loaded in the head section of the html
 * document; alternatively, the css rule above must be included in the external stylesheet of the
 * application.
 *
 * Legacy browsers, like IE7, do not provide attribute selector support (added in CSS 2.1) so they
 * cannot match the `[ng\:cloak]` selector. To work around this limitation, you must add the css
 * class `ng-cloak` in addition to the `ngCloak` directive as shown in the example below.
 *
 * @element ANY
 *
 * @example
   <example>
     <file name="index.html">
        <div id="template1" ng-cloak>{{ 'hello' }}</div>
        <div id="template2" ng-cloak class="ng-cloak">{{ 'hello IE7' }}</div>

/**
 * @ngdoc directive
 * @name ngController
 *
 * @description
 * The `ngController` directive attaches a controller class to the view. This is a key aspect of how angular
 * supports the principles behind the Model-View-Controller design pattern.
 *
 * MVC components in angular:
 *
 * * Model — Models are the properties of a scope; scopes are attached to the DOM where scope properties
 *   are accessed through bindings.
 * * View — The template (HTML with data bindings) that is rendered into the View.
 * * Controller — The `ngController` directive specifies a Controller class; the class contains business
 *   logic behind the application to decorate the scope with functions and values
 *
 * Note that you can also attach controllers to the DOM by declaring it in a route definition
 * via the {@link ngRoute.$route $route} service. A common mistake is to declare the controller
 * again using `ng-controller` in the template itself.  This will cause the controller to be attached
 * and executed twice.
 *
 * @element ANY
 * @scope
 * @priority 500
 * @param {expression} ngController Name of a constructor function registered with the current
 * {@link ng.$controllerProvider $controllerProvider} or an {@link guide/expression expression}
 * that on the current scope evaluates to a constructor function.
 *
 * The controller instance can be published into a scope property by specifying
 * `ng-controller="as propertyName"`.
 *
 * If the current `$controllerProvider` is configured to use globals (via
 * {@link ng.$controllerProvider#allowGlobals `$controllerProvider.allowGlobals()` }), this may
 * also be the name of a globally accessible constructor function (not recommended).
 *
 * @example
 * Here is a simple form for editing user contact information. Adding, removing, clearing, and
 * greeting are methods declared on the controller (see source tab). These methods can
 * easily be called from the angular markup. Any changes to the data are automatically reflected
 * in the View without the need for a manual update.
 *
 * Two different declaration styles are included below:
 *
 * * one binds methods and properties directly onto the controller using `this`:
 * `ng-controller="SettingsController1 as settings"`
 * * one injects `$scope` into the controller:
 * `ng-controller="SettingsController2"`
 *
 * The second option is more common in the Angular community, and is generally used in boilerplates
 * and in this guide. However, there are advantages to binding properties directly to the controller
 * and avoiding scope.
 *
 * * Using `controller as` makes it obvious which controller you are accessing in the template when
 * multiple controllers apply to an element.
 * * If you are writing your controllers as classes you have easier access to the properties and
 * methods, which will appear on the scope, from inside the controller code.
 * * Since there is always a `.` in the bindings, you don't have to worry about prototypal
 * inheritance masking primitives.
 *
 * This example demonstrates the `controller as` syntax.

/**
 * @ngdoc directive
 * @name ngCsp
 *
 * @element html
 * @description
 * Enables [CSP (Content Security Policy)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Security/CSP) support.
 *
 * This is necessary when developing things like Google Chrome Extensions or Universal Windows Apps.
 *
 * CSP forbids apps to use `eval` or `Function(string)` generated functions (among other things).
 * For Angular to be CSP compatible there are only two things that we need to do differently:
 *
 * - don't use `Function` constructor to generate optimized value getters
 * - don't inject custom stylesheet into the document
 *
 * AngularJS uses `Function(string)` generated functions as a speed optimization. Applying the `ngCsp`
 * directive will cause Angular to use CSP compatibility mode. When this mode is on AngularJS will
 * evaluate all expressions up to 30% slower than in non-CSP mode, but no security violations will
 * be raised.
 *
 * CSP forbids JavaScript to inline stylesheet rules. In non CSP mode Angular automatically
 * includes some CSS rules (e.g. {@link ng.directive:ngCloak ngCloak}).
 * To make those directives work in CSP mode, include the `angular-csp.css` manually.
 *
 * Angular tries to autodetect if CSP is active and automatically turn on the CSP-safe mode. This
 * autodetection however triggers a CSP error to be logged in the console:
 *
 * ```
 * Refused to evaluate a string as JavaScript because 'unsafe-eval' is not an allowed source of
 * script in the following Content Security Policy directive: "default-src 'self'". Note that
 * 'script-src' was not explicitly set, so 'default-src' is used as a fallback.
 * ```
 *
 * This error is harmless but annoying. To prevent the error from showing up, put the `ngCsp`
 * directive on the root element of the application or on the `angular.js` script tag, whichever
 * appears first in the html document.
 *
 * *Note: This directive is only available in the `ng-csp` and `data-ng-csp` attribute form.*
 *
 * @example
 * This example shows how to apply the `ngCsp` directive to the `html` tag.
   ```html
     <!doctype html>
     <html ng-app ng-csp>
     ...
     ...
     </html>
   ```
  * @example
      // Note: the suffix `.csp` in the example name triggers
      // csp mode in our http server!

/**
 * @ngdoc directive
 * @name ngIf
 * @restrict A
 *
 * @description
 * The `ngIf` directive removes or recreates a portion of the DOM tree based on an
 * {expression}. If the expression assigned to `ngIf` evaluates to a false
 * value then the element is removed from the DOM, otherwise a clone of the
 * element is reinserted into the DOM.
 *
 * `ngIf` differs from `ngShow` and `ngHide` in that `ngIf` completely removes and recreates the
 * element in the DOM rather than changing its visibility via the `display` css property.  A common
 * case when this difference is significant is when using css selectors that rely on an element's
 * position within the DOM, such as the `:first-child` or `:last-child` pseudo-classes.
 *
 * Note that when an element is removed using `ngIf` its scope is destroyed and a new scope
 * is created when the element is restored.  The scope created within `ngIf` inherits from
 * its parent scope using
 * [prototypal inheritance](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/wiki/Understanding-Scopes#javascript-prototypal-inheritance).
 * An important implication of this is if `ngModel` is used within `ngIf` to bind to
 * a javascript primitive defined in the parent scope. In this case any modifications made to the
 * variable within the child scope will override (hide) the value in the parent scope.
 *
 * Also, `ngIf` recreates elements using their compiled state. An example of this behavior
 * is if an element's class attribute is directly modified after it's compiled, using something like
 * jQuery's `.addClass()` method, and the element is later removed. When `ngIf` recreates the element
 * the added class will be lost because the original compiled state is used to regenerate the element.
 *
 * Additionally, you can provide animations via the `ngAnimate` module to animate the `enter`
 * and `leave` effects.
 *
 * @animations
 * enter - happens just after the `ngIf` contents change and a new DOM element is created and injected into the `ngIf` container
 * leave - happens just before the `ngIf` contents are removed from the DOM
 *
 * @element ANY
 * @scope
 * @priority 600
 * @param {expression} ngIf If the {@link guide/expression expression} is falsy then
 *     the element is removed from the DOM tree. If it is truthy a copy of the compiled
 *     element is added to the DOM tree.
 *
 * @example

/**
 * @ngdoc directive
 * @name ngPluralize
 * @restrict EA
 *
 * @description
 * `ngPluralize` is a directive that displays messages according to en-US localization rules.
 * These rules are bundled with angular.js, but can be overridden
 * (see {@link guide/i18n Angular i18n} dev guide). You configure ngPluralize directive
 * by specifying the mappings between
 * [plural categories](http://unicode.org/repos/cldr-tmp/trunk/diff/supplemental/language_plural_rules.html)
 * and the strings to be displayed.
 *
 * # Plural categories and explicit number rules
 * There are two
 * [plural categories](http://unicode.org/repos/cldr-tmp/trunk/diff/supplemental/language_plural_rules.html)
 * in Angular's default en-US locale: "one" and "other".
 *
 * While a plural category may match many numbers (for example, in en-US locale, "other" can match
 * any number that is not 1), an explicit number rule can only match one number. For example, the
 * explicit number rule for "3" matches the number 3. There are examples of plural categories
 * and explicit number rules throughout the rest of this documentation.
 *
 * # Configuring ngPluralize
 * You configure ngPluralize by providing 2 attributes: `count` and `when`.
 * You can also provide an optional attribute, `offset`.
 *
 * The value of the `count` attribute can be either a string or an {@link guide/expression
 * Angular expression}; these are evaluated on the current scope for its bound value.
 *
 * The `when` attribute specifies the mappings between plural categories and the actual
 * string to be displayed. The value of the attribute should be a JSON object.
 *
 * The following example shows how to configure ngPluralize:
 *
 * ```html
 * <ng-pluralize count="personCount"
                 when="{'0': 'Nobody is viewing.',
 *                      'one': '1 person is viewing.',
 *                      'other': '{} people are viewing.'}">
 * </ng-pluralize>
 *```
 *
 * In the example, `"0: Nobody is viewing."` is an explicit number rule. If you did not
 * specify this rule, 0 would be matched to the "other" category and "0 people are viewing"
 * would be shown instead of "Nobody is viewing". You can specify an explicit number rule for
 * other numbers, for example 12, so that instead of showing "12 people are viewing", you can
 * show "a dozen people are viewing".
 *
 * You can use a set of closed braces (`{}`) as a placeholder for the number that you want substituted
 * into pluralized strings. In the previous example, Angular will replace `{}` with
 * <span ng-non-bindable>`{{personCount}}`</span>. The closed braces `{}` is a placeholder
 * for <span ng-non-bindable>{{numberExpression}}</span>.
 *
 * # Configuring ngPluralize with offset
 * The `offset` attribute allows further customization of pluralized text, which can result in
 * a better user experience. For example, instead of the message "4 people are viewing this document",
 * you might display "John, Kate and 2 others are viewing this document".
 * The offset attribute allows you to offset a number by any desired value.
 * Let's take a look at an example:
 *
 * ```html
 * <ng-pluralize count="personCount" offset=2
 *               when="{'0': 'Nobody is viewing.',
 *                      '1': '{{person1}} is viewing.',
 *                      '2': '{{person1}} and {{person2}} are viewing.',
 *                      'one': '{{person1}}, {{person2}} and one other person are viewing.',
 *                      'other': '{{person1}}, {{person2}} and {} other people are viewing.'}">
 * </ng-pluralize>
 * ```
 *
 * Notice that we are still using two plural categories(one, other), but we added
 * three explicit number rules 0, 1 and 2.
 * When one person, perhaps John, views the document, "John is viewing" will be shown.
 * When three people view the document, no explicit number rule is found, so
 * an offset of 2 is taken off 3, and Angular uses 1 to decide the plural category.
 * In this case, plural category 'one' is matched and "John, Mary and one other person are viewing"
 * is shown.
 *
 * Note that when you specify offsets, you must provide explicit number rules for
 * numbers from 0 up to and including the offset. If you use an offset of 3, for example,
 * you must provide explicit number rules for 0, 1, 2 and 3. You must also provide plural strings for
 * plural categories "one" and "other".
 *
 * @param {string|expression} count The variable to be bound to.
 * @param {string} when The mapping between plural category to its corresponding strings.
 * @param {number=} offset Offset to deduct from the total number.
 *
 * @example

/**
 * @ngdoc directive

 *
 * @description
 * The `ngRepeat` directive instantiates a template once per item from a collection. Each template
 * instance gets its own scope, where the given loop variable is set to the current collection item,
 * and `$index` is set to the item index or key.
 *
 * Special properties are exposed on the local scope of each template instance, including:
 *
 * | Variable  | Type            | Details                                                                     |
 * |-----------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 * | `$index`  | {@type number}  | iterator offset of the repeated element (0..length-1)                       |
 * | `$first`  | {@type boolean} | true if the repeated element is first in the iterator.                      |
 * | `$middle` | {@type boolean} | true if the repeated element is between the first and last in the iterator. |
 * | `$last`   | {@type boolean} | true if the repeated element is last in the iterator.                       |
 * | `$even`   | {@type boolean} | true if the iterator position `$index` is even (otherwise false).           |
 * | `$odd`    | {@type boolean} | true if the iterator position `$index` is odd (otherwise false).            |
 *
 * Creating aliases for these properties is possible with {@link ng.directive:ngInit `ngInit`}.
 * This may be useful when, for instance, nesting ngRepeats.
 *
 * # Special repeat start and end points
 * To repeat a series of elements instead of just one parent element, ngRepeat (as well as other ng directives) supports extending
 * the range of the repeater by defining explicit start and end points by using **ng-repeat-start** and **ng-repeat-end** respectively.
 * The **ng-repeat-start** directive works the same as **ng-repeat**, but will repeat all the HTML code (including the tag it's defined on)
 * up to and including the ending HTML tag where **ng-repeat-end** is placed.
 *
 * The example below makes use of this feature:
 * ```html
 *   <header ng-repeat-start="item in items">
 *     Header {{ item }}
 *   </header>
 *   <div class="body">
 *     Body {{ item }}
 *   </div>
 *   <footer ng-repeat-end>
 *     Footer {{ item }}
 *   </footer>
 * ```
 *
 * And with an input of {@type ['A','B']} for the items variable in the example above, the output will evaluate to:
 * ```html
 *   <header>
 *     Header A
 *   </header>
 *   <div class="body">
 *     Body A
 *   </div>
 *   <footer>
 *     Footer A
 *   </footer>
 *   <header>
 *     Header B
 *   </header>
 *   <div class="body">
 *     Body B
 *   </div>
 *   <footer>
 *     Footer B
 *   </footer>
 * ```
 *
 * The custom start and end points for ngRepeat also support all other HTML directive syntax flavors provided in AngularJS (such
 * as **data-ng-repeat-start**, **x-ng-repeat-start** and **ng:repeat-start**).
 *
 * @animations
 * **.enter** - when a new item is added to the list or when an item is revealed after a filter
 *
 * **.leave** - when an item is removed from the list or when an item is filtered out
 *
 * **.move** - when an adjacent item is filtered out causing a reorder or when the item contents are reordered
 *
 * @element ANY
 * @scope
 * @priority 1000
 * @param {repeat_expression} ngRepeat The expression indicating how to enumerate a collection. These
 *   formats are currently supported:
 *
 *   * `variable in expression` – where variable is the user defined loop variable and `expression`
 *     is a scope expression giving the collection to enumerate.
 *
 *     For example: `album in artist.albums`.
 *
 *   * `(key, value) in expression` – where `key` and `value` can be any user defined identifiers,
 *     and `expression` is the scope expression giving the collection to enumerate.
 *
 *     For example: `(name, age) in {'adam':10, 'amalie':12}`.
 *
 *   * `variable in expression track by tracking_expression` – You can also provide an optional tracking function
 *     which can be used to associate the objects in the collection with the DOM elements. If no tracking function
 *     is specified the ng-repeat associates elements by identity in the collection. It is an error to have
 *     more than one tracking function to resolve to the same key. (This would mean that two distinct objects are
 *     mapped to the same DOM element, which is not possible.)  Filters should be applied to the expression,
 *     before specifying a tracking expression.
 *
 *     For example: `item in items` is equivalent to `item in items track by $id(item)`. This implies that the DOM elements
 *     will be associated by item identity in the array.
 *
 *     For example: `item in items track by $id(item)`. A built in `$id()` function can be used to assign a unique
 *     `$$hashKey` property to each item in the array. This property is then used as a key to associated DOM elements
 *     with the corresponding item in the array by identity. Moving the same object in array would move the DOM
 *     element in the same way in the DOM.
 *
 *     For example: `item in items track by item.id` is a typical pattern when the items come from the database. In this
 *     case the object identity does not matter. Two objects are considered equivalent as long as their `id`
 *     property is same.
 *
 *     For example: `item in items | filter:searchText track by item.id` is a pattern that might be used to apply a filter
 *     to items in conjunction with a tracking expression.
 *
 *   * `variable in expression as alias_expression` – You can also provide an optional alias expression which will then store the
 *     intermediate results of the repeater after the filters have been applied. Typically this is used to render a special message
 *     when a filter is active on the repeater, but the filtered result set is empty.
 *
 *     For example: `item in items | filter:x as results` will store the fragment of the repeated items as `results`, but only after
 *     the items have been processed through the filter.
 *
 * @example
 * This example initializes the scope to a list of names and
 * then uses `ngRepeat` to display every person:

/**
 * @ngdoc directive
 * @name ngShow
 *
 * @description
 * The `ngShow` directive shows or hides the given HTML element based on the expression
 * provided to the `ngShow` attribute. The element is shown or hidden by removing or adding
 * the `.ng-hide` CSS class onto the element. The `.ng-hide` CSS class is predefined
 * in AngularJS and sets the display style to none (using an !important flag).
 * For CSP mode please add `angular-csp.css` to your html file (see {@link ng.directive:ngCsp ngCsp}).
 *
 * ```html
 * <!-- when $scope.myValue is truthy (element is visible) -->
 * <div ng-show="myValue"></div>
 *
 * <!-- when $scope.myValue is falsy (element is hidden) -->
 * <div ng-show="myValue" class="ng-hide"></div>
 * ```
 *
 * When the `ngShow` expression evaluates to a falsy value then the `.ng-hide` CSS class is added to the class
 * attribute on the element causing it to become hidden. When truthy, the `.ng-hide` CSS class is removed
 * from the element causing the element not to appear hidden.
 *
 * ## Why is !important used?
 *
 * You may be wondering why !important is used for the `.ng-hide` CSS class. This is because the `.ng-hide` selector
 * can be easily overridden by heavier selectors. For example, something as simple
 * as changing the display style on a HTML list item would make hidden elements appear visible.
 * This also becomes a bigger issue when dealing with CSS frameworks.
 *
 * By using !important, the show and hide behavior will work as expected despite any clash between CSS selector
 * specificity (when !important isn't used with any conflicting styles). If a developer chooses to override the
 * styling to change how to hide an element then it is just a matter of using !important in their own CSS code.
 *
 * ### Overriding `.ng-hide`
 *
 * By default, the `.ng-hide` class will style the element with `display: none!important`. If you wish to change
 * the hide behavior with ngShow/ngHide then this can be achieved by restating the styles for the `.ng-hide`
 * class in CSS:
 *
 * ```css
 * .ng-hide {
 *   /&#42; this is just another form of hiding an element &#42;/
 *   display: block!important;
 *   position: absolute;
 *   top: -9999px;
 *   left: -9999px;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * By default you don't need to override in CSS anything and the animations will work around the display style.
 *
 * ## A note about animations with `ngShow`
 *
 * Animations in ngShow/ngHide work with the show and hide events that are triggered when the directive expression
 * is true and false. This system works like the animation system present with ngClass except that
 * you must also include the !important flag to override the display property
 * so that you can perform an animation when the element is hidden during the time of the animation.
 *
 * ```css
 * //
 * //a working example can be found at the bottom of this page
 * //
 * .my-element.ng-hide-add, .my-element.ng-hide-remove {
 *   /&#42; this is required as of 1.3x to properly
 *      apply all styling in a show/hide animation &#42;/
 *   transition: 0s linear all;
 * }
 *
 * .my-element.ng-hide-add-active,
 * .my-element.ng-hide-remove-active {
 *   /&#42; the transition is defined in the active class &#42;/
 *   transition: 1s linear all;
 * }
 *
 * .my-element.ng-hide-add { ... }
 * .my-element.ng-hide-add.ng-hide-add-active { ... }
 * .my-element.ng-hide-remove { ... }
 * .my-element.ng-hide-remove.ng-hide-remove-active { ... }
 * ```
 *
 * Keep in mind that, as of AngularJS version 1.3.0-beta.11, there is no need to change the display
 * property to block during animation states--ngAnimate will handle the style toggling automatically for you.
 *
 * @animations
 * addClass: `.ng-hide` - happens after the `ngShow` expression evaluates to a truthy value and the just before contents are set to visible
 * removeClass: `.ng-hide` - happens after the `ngShow` expression evaluates to a non truthy value and just before the contents are set to hidden
 *
 * @element ANY
 * @param {expression} ngShow If the {@link guide/expression expression} is truthy
 *     then the element is shown or hidden respectively.

/**
 * @ngdoc directive
 * @name ngSwitch
 * @restrict EA
 *
 * @description
 * The `ngSwitch` directive is used to conditionally swap DOM structure on your template based on a scope expression.
 * Elements within `ngSwitch` but without `ngSwitchWhen` or `ngSwitchDefault` directives will be preserved at the location
 * as specified in the template.
 *
 * The directive itself works similar to ngInclude, however, instead of downloading template code (or loading it
 * from the template cache), `ngSwitch` simply chooses one of the nested elements and makes it visible based on which element
 * matches the value obtained from the evaluated expression. In other words, you define a container element
 * (where you place the directive), place an expression on the **`on="..."` attribute**
 * (or the **`ng-switch="..."` attribute**), define any inner elements inside of the directive and place
 * a when attribute per element. The when attribute is used to inform ngSwitch which element to display when the on
 * expression is evaluated. If a matching expression is not found via a when attribute then an element with the default
 * attribute is displayed.
 *
 * <div class="alert alert-info">
 * Be aware that the attribute values to match against cannot be expressions. They are interpreted
 * as literal string values to match against.
 * For example, **`ng-switch-when="someVal"`** will match against the string `"someVal"` not against the
 * value of the expression `$scope.someVal`.
 * </div>

 * @animations
 * enter - happens after the ngSwitch contents change and the matched child element is placed inside the container
 * leave - happens just after the ngSwitch contents change and just before the former contents are removed from the DOM
 *
 * @usage
 *
 * ```
 * <ANY ng-switch="expression">
 *   <ANY ng-switch-when="matchValue1">...</ANY>
 *   <ANY ng-switch-when="matchValue2">...</ANY>
 *   <ANY ng-switch-default>...</ANY>
 * </ANY>
 * ```
 *
 *
 * @scope
 * @priority 1200
 * @param {*} ngSwitch|on expression to match against <tt>ng-switch-when</tt>.
 * On child elements add:
 *
 * * `ngSwitchWhen`: the case statement to match against. If match then this
 *   case will be displayed. If the same match appears multiple times, all the
 *   elements will be displayed.
 * * `ngSwitchDefault`: the default case when no other case match. If there
 *   are multiple default cases, all of them will be displayed when no other
 *   case match.

 * @ngdoc directive

 *
 * @description
 * HTML `SELECT` element with angular data-binding.
 *
 * # `ngOptions`
 *
 * The `ngOptions` attribute can be used to dynamically generate a list of `<option>`
 * elements for the `<select>` element using the array or object obtained by evaluating the
 * `ngOptions` comprehension_expression.
 *
 * In many cases, `ngRepeat` can be used on `<option>` elements instead of `ngOptions` to achieve a
 * similar result. However, the `ngOptions` provides some benefits such as reducing memory and
 * increasing speed by not creating a new scope for each repeated instance, as well as providing
 * more flexibility in how the `select`'s model is assigned via `select as`. `ngOptions` should be
 * used when the `select` model needs to be bound to a non-string value. This is because an option
 * element can only be bound to string values at present.
 *
 * When an item in the `<select>` menu is selected, the array element or object property
 * represented by the selected option will be bound to the model identified by the `ngModel`
 * directive.
 *
 * Optionally, a single hard-coded `<option>` element, with the value set to an empty string, can
 * be nested into the `<select>` element. This element will then represent the `null` or "not selected"
 * option. See example below for demonstration.
 *
 * <div class="alert alert-warning">
 * **Note:** `ngModel` compares by reference, not value. This is important when binding to an
 * array of objects. See an example [in this jsfiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/qWzTb/).
 * </div>
 *
 * ## `select as`
 *
 * Using `select as` will bind the result of the `select as` expression to the model, but
 * the value of the `<select>` and `<option>` html elements will be either the index (for array data sources)
 * or property name (for object data sources) of the value within the collection. If a `track by` expression
 * is used, the result of that expression will be set as the value of the `option` and `select` elements.
 *
 * ### `select as` with `track by`
 *
 * Using `select as` together with `track by` is not recommended. Reasoning:
 *
 * - Example: &lt;select ng-options="item.subItem as item.label for item in values track by item.id" ng-model="selected"&gt;
 *   values: [{id: 1, label: 'aLabel', subItem: {name: 'aSubItem'}}, {id: 2, label: 'bLabel', subItem: {name: 'bSubItem'}}],
 *   $scope.selected = {name: 'aSubItem'};
 * - track by is always applied to `value`, with the purpose of preserving the selection,
 *   (to `item` in this case)
 * - to calculate whether an item is selected we do the following:
 *   1. apply `track by` to the values in the array, e.g.
 *      In the example: [1,2]
 *   2. apply `track by` to the already selected value in `ngModel`:
 *      In the example: this is not possible, as `track by` refers to `item.id`, but the selected
 *      value from `ngModel` is `{name: aSubItem}`.
 *
 * @param {string} ngModel Assignable angular expression to data-bind to.
 * @param {string=} name Property name of the form under which the control is published.
 * @param {string=} required The control is considered valid only if value is entered.
 * @param {string=} ngRequired Adds `required` attribute and `required` validation constraint to
 *    the element when the ngRequired expression evaluates to true. Use `ngRequired` instead of
 *    `required` when you want to data-bind to the `required` attribute.
 * @param {comprehension_expression=} ngOptions in one of the following forms:
 *
 *   * for array data sources:
 *     * `label` **`for`** `value` **`in`** `array`
 *     * `select` **`as`** `label` **`for`** `value` **`in`** `array`
 *     * `label` **`group by`** `group` **`for`** `value` **`in`** `array`
 *     * `label` **`group by`** `group` **`for`** `value` **`in`** `array` **`track by`** `trackexpr`
 *     * `label` **`for`** `value` **`in`** `array` | orderBy:`orderexpr` **`track by`** `trackexpr`
 *        (for including a filter with `track by`)
 *   * for object data sources:
 *     * `label` **`for (`**`key` **`,`** `value`**`) in`** `object`
 *     * `select` **`as`** `label` **`for (`**`key` **`,`** `value`**`) in`** `object`
 *     * `label` **`group by`** `group` **`for (`**`key`**`,`** `value`**`) in`** `object`
 *     * `select` **`as`** `label` **`group by`** `group`
 *         **`for` `(`**`key`**`,`** `value`**`) in`** `object`
 *
 * Where:
 *
 *   * `array` / `object`: an expression which evaluates to an array / object to iterate over.
 *   * `value`: local variable which will refer to each item in the `array` or each property value
 *      of `object` during iteration.
 *   * `key`: local variable which will refer to a property name in `object` during iteration.
 *   * `label`: The result of this expression will be the label for `<option>` element. The
 *     `expression` will most likely refer to the `value` variable (e.g. `value.propertyName`).
 *   * `select`: The result of this expression will be bound to the model of the parent `<select>`
 *      element. If not specified, `select` expression will default to `value`.
 *   * `group`: The result of this expression will be used to group options using the `<optgroup>`
 *      DOM element.
 *   * `trackexpr`: Used when working with an array of objects. The result of this expression will be
 *      used to identify the objects in the array. The `trackexpr` will most likely refer to the
 *     `value` variable (e.g. `value.propertyName`). With this the selection is preserved
 *      even when the options are recreated (e.g. reloaded from the server).
